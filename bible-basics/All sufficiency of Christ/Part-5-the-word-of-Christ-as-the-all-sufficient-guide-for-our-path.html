            If the reader has been enabled, through grace, to make his own of what has passed before our minds in this series of papers, he will have a 
            perfect remedy for all uneasiness of conscience and all restlessness of heart. The work of Christ, if only it be laid hold of by an artless 
            faith, must, of blessed necessity, meet the former; and the Person of Christ, if only He be contemplated with a single eye, must perfectly 
            meet the latter. If, therefore, we are not in the enjoyment of peace of conscience, it can only be because we are not resting on the finished 
            work of Christ; and if the heart is not at ease, it proves that we are not satisfied with Christ Himself.

          <h2>The danger of not understanding our relationship with God</h2>
          <p>
            And yet, alas! how few, even of the Lord's beloved people, know either the one or the other. How rare is it to find a person in the enjoyment of 
            true peace of conscience and rest of heart! In general, Christians are not a whit in advance of the condition of Old Testament saints. they do not 
            know the blessedness of an accomplished redemption. They are not in the enjoyment of a purged conscience. They cannot draw nigh with a true heart, 
            in full assurance of faith, having the heart sprinkled from an evil conscience, and the body washed with pure water. They do not apprehend the 
            grand truth of the indwelling of the Holy Ghost, enabling them to cry, <b>"Abba, Father."</b> They are, as to their experience, under law. They have never 
            really entered into the deep blessedness of being under the reign of grace. They have life. It is impossible to doubt this. They love divine things. 
            Their tastes, their habits, their aspirations, yea, their very exercises, their conflicts, their anxieties, doubts, and fears, all go to prove the 
            existence of divine life. They are, in a way, separated from the world, but their separation is rather negative than positive. It is more because 
            they see the utter vanity of the world, and its inability to satisfy their hearts, than because they have found an object in Christ. They have lost 
            their taste for the things of the world, but they have not found their place and their portion in the Son of God where He now is at the right hand 
            of God. The things of the world cannot satisfy them, and they are not in the enjoyment of their proper heavenly standing, object, and hope; hence 
            they are in an anomalous condition altogether; they have no certainty, no rest, no fixedness of purpose; they are not happy; they do not know their 
            true bearings; they are neither one thing nor the other.
          </p>

          <p>
            Is it thus with the reader? We fondly hope not. We trust he is one of those who, through infinite grace. <b>"know the things that are freely given 
              them of God,"</b> who know that they have passed from death to life — that they have eternal life; who enjoy the precious witness of the Spirit; 
              who realise their association with a risen and glorified Head in the heavens, with whom they are linked by the Holy Ghost who dwells in them; 
              who have found their object in the Person of that blessed One whose finished work is the divine and eternal basis of their salvation and peace; 
              and who are earnestly looking for the blessed moment when Jesus shall come to receive them to Himself, that where He is they may be also, to go 
              no more out for ever.
          </p>

              This is Christianity. Nothing else deserves the name. It stands out in bold and striking contrast with the spurious religiousness of the day, 
              which is neither pure Judaism on the one hand, nor pure Christianity on the other, but a wretched mixture, composed of some of the elements of 
              each, which unconverted people can adopt and go on with, because it sanctions the lusts of the flesh, and allows them to enjoy the pleasures and 
              vanities of the world to their heart's content. The arch-enemy of Christ and of souls has succeeded in producing an awful system of religion, 
              half-Jewish, half-Christian, combining, in the most artful manner, the world and the flesh, with a certain amount of scripture so used as to 
              destroy its moral force, and hinder it’s just application. In the meshes of this system souls are hopelessly entangled. Unconverted people are 
              deceived into the notion that they are very good Christians indeed, and going on all right to heaven. And, on the other hand, the Lord's dear 
              people are robbed of their proper place and privileges, and dragged down by the dark and depressing influence of the religious atmosphere which 
              surrounds and almost suffocates them.

          </p>

          <p>
              It lies not, we believe, within the compass of human language to set forth the appalling consequences of this mingling of the people of God 
              with the people of the world in one common system of religiousness and theological belief. Its effect upon the former is to blind their eyes to the 
              true moral glories of Christianity as set forth in the pages of the New Testament; and this to such an extent, that if any one attempts to unfold 
              these glories to their view, he is regarded as a visionary enthusiast, or a dangerous heretic. Its effect upon the latter is to deceive them altogether 
              as to their true condition, character, and destiny. Both classes repeat the same formularies, subscribe the same creed, say the same prayers, are 
              members of the same community partake of the same sacrament, are, in short, ecclesiastically, theologically, religiously one.
          </p>

          <p>
            It will, perhaps, be said in reply to all this, that our Lord, in His wonderful discourse in Matthew 13, distinctly teaches that the wheat and 
            the tares are to grow together. Yes; but where? In the church? Nay; but "in the field;" and He tells us that <b>"the field is the world."</b> To confound 
            these things is to falsify the whole Christian position, and to do away with all godly discipline in the assembly. It is to place the teaching of 
            our Lord in Matthew 13 in opposition to the teaching of the Holy Ghost in 1 Corinthians 5.

          <h2>The importance of the Word of Christ to a Christian</h2>
          <p>
              However, we shall not pursue this subject further just now. It is far too important and too extensive to be disposed of in a brief article like 
              the present. We may, perhaps, discuss it more fully on some future occasion. That it demands the serious consideration of the Christian reader 
              we are most thoroughly convinced; bearing, as it does, so manifestly on the glory of Christ on the true interests of His people, on the progress 
              of the gospel, on the integrity of Christian testimony and service, it would be quite impossible to overestimate its importance. But we must 
              leave it for the present, and draw this paper to a close by a brief reference to the third and last branch of our subject, namely, <em>the word of 
              Christ as the all-sufficient guide for our path.</em>
          </p>

          <p>
            If Christ's work suffices for the conscience, if His blessed Person suffices for the heart, then, most assuredly, His precious word suffices for 
            the path. We may assert, with all possible confidence, that we possess in the divine volume of holy scripture all we can ever need, not only to 
            meet all the exigencies of our individual path, but also the varied necessities of the church of God, in the most minute details of her history in 
            this world.
          </p>

          <p>
            We are quite aware that in making this assertion we lay ourselves open to much scorn and opposition, in more quarters than one. We shall be met on 
            the one hand by the advocates of tradition, and on the other by those who contend for the supremacy of man's reason and will. But this gives us 
            very little concern indeed. We regard the traditions of men, whether fathers, brothers, or doctors, if presented as an authority, as the small dust 
            of the balance; and as to human reason, it can only be compared to a bat in the sunshine, dazzled by the brightness, and blindly dashing itself 
            against objects which it cannot see. It is the deepest joy of the Christian's heart to retire from the conflicting traditions and doctrines of men 
            into the calm light of holy scripture; and when encountered by the impudent reasoning's of the infidel, the rationalist, and the sceptic, to bow 
            down his whole moral being to the authority and power of holy scripture. He thankfully recognises in the word of God the only perfect standard for 
            doctrine, for morals, for everything. <b>"All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, 
            for instruction in righteousness; that the man of God may be perfect</b> [artios]<b>, <em>throughly</em> furnished to all <em>Good works</em>."</b>
          </p>

          <p>
            What more can we need? Nothing. If scripture can make a child "wise to salvation," and if it can make a man <b>"perfect,"</b> and furnish him 
            <b>"throughly to all good works,"</b> what do we want of human tradition or human reasonings? If God has written a volume for us, if He has 
            graciously condescended to give us a revelation of His mind, as to all we ought to know, and think, and feel, and believe, and do, shall we 
            turn to a poor fellow-mortal — be he ritualist or rationalist — to help us? Far away be the thought! As well might we turn to our fellow-man 
            to add something to the finished work of Christ, in order to render it sufficient for our conscience, or to supply some deficiency in the 
            Person of Christ, in order to render Him a sufficient object for the heart, as to betake ourselves to human tradition or human reason to 
            supply some deficiency in divine revelation.
          </p>

          <p>
            All praise and thanks to our God, it is not so. He has given us in His own beloved Son all we want for the conscience, for the heart, for the 
            path — for time, with all its changing scenes — for eternity, with its countless ages. We can say, "You, O Christ, are all we want; more than 
            all in You we find." There is, there could be, no lack in the Christ of God. His atonement and advocacy must satisfy all the cravings of the 
            most deeply exercised conscience. The moral glories, the powerful attractions, of His divine Person must satisfy the most intense aspirations 
            and longings of the heart. And His peerless revelation — that priceless volume contains within its covers all we can possibly need, 
            from the starting post to the goal of our Christian career.

          <h2>A final challenge</h2>
          <p>
            Christian reader, are not these things so? Do you not, from the very centre of your renewed moral being, acknowledge the truth of them? If so, 
            are you resting, in calm repose, on Christ's work? Are you delighting in His Person? Are you submitting in all things to the authority of His 
            word? God grant it may be so with you, and with all who profess His name! May there be a fuller, clearer, and more decided testimony to “The 
            All-sufficiency of Christ," till "that day!"
