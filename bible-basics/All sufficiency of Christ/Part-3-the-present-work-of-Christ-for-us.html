          <h2>The work of Christ is certain and complete </h2>
          <p>
              From what has already passed before us, we learn that the grand result of the work of Christ in the past is to give us a divinely perfect 
              standing before God. <b>"He has perfected for ever them that are sanctified."</b> He has introduced us into the Divine Presence, in all His own 
              perfect acceptability, in the full credit and virtue of His name, of His Person, and of His work; so that, as the Apostle John declares, <b>"As 
              he is, so are we in this world." (1 John 4:17).</b>

          </p>

          <p>
            Such is the settled standing of the very feeblest lamb in all the blood-bought flock of Christ. Nor could it possibly be otherwise. It must be 
            either this or eternal perdition. There is not the breadth of a hair between this standing of absolute perfectness before God and a condition of 
            guilt and ruin. We are either in our sins, or in a risen Christ. There is no middle ground. We are either covered with guilt, or complete in 
            Christ. But the believer is declared, by the authoritative voice of the Holy Ghost in scripture, to be <b>"complete in Christ" — "Perfect, as 
              pertaining to his conscience" — "Perfected in perpetuity" — "Clean every whit" — "accepted in the beloved" — "Made</b> [or become] <b>the righteousness 
              of God in Christ."</b>

          </p>

          <p>
            And all this through the sacrifice of the cross. That precious atoning death of Christ forms the solid and irrefragable foundation of the 
            Christian's standing. <b>"This man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins, for ever sat down on the right hand of God."</b> A seated Christ is the 
            glorious proof and the perfect definition of the believer's Place in the presence of God. Our Lord Christ, having glorified God about our sins, 
            and borne His judgment on our entire condition as sinners, has conducted as, in living association with Himself, into a place, not only of 
            forgiveness, acceptance, and peace, but of complete deliverance from the dominion of sin — a place of assured victory over everything that could 
            possibly be against us, whether indwelling sin, the fear of Satan, the law, or this present evil world. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Such, we repeat, is the absolutely settled standing of the believer, if we are to be taught by holy scripture. And we earnestly entreat the 
            Christian reader not to be satisfied with anything less than this. Let him not any longer accept the muddled teachings of Christendom's creeds, 
            and its liturgical services, which only drive the soul back into the darkness, distance, and bondage of Judaism — that system which God found 
            fault with, and which He has for ever abolished, because it did not meet His holy mind, or satisfy His Loving heart, in giving the worshipper 
            perfect peace, perfect liberty, perfect nearness to Himself, and that for ever.

          <h2>Challenge doctrine to ensure it is based on scripture and that it is not robbing us of Christian privileges</h2>
          <p>
              We solemnly call upon all the Lord's people, throughout the various sections of the professing church, to consider where they are, and to see 
              how far they understand and enjoy the true Christian position, as set forth in the various passages of scripture which we have quoted, and which 
              might easily be multiplied a hundredfold. Let them diligently and faithfully compare the teachings of Christendom with the word of God, and see 
              how far they agree. In this way they will find how completely the professing Christianity of the present day stands in contrast with the living 
              teachings of the New Testament; and, as a consequence, souls are robbed of the precious privileges which belong to them as Christians, and they 
              are kept in the moral distance which characterised the Mosaic economy.
 
          </p>

         
          <p>
              All this is most deplorable. It grieves the Holy Spirit, wounds the heart of Christ, dishonours the grace of God, and contradicts the plainest statements 
              of holy scripture. We are most thoroughly persuaded that the condition of thousands of precious souls at this moment is enough to make the heart bleed; 
              and all this, to a large extent, is traceable to Christendom's teachings, its creeds and its formularies. Where will you find, amid the ordinary ranks of 
              Christian profession, a person in the enjoyment of a perfectly purged conscience, of peace with God, of the Spirit of adoption? Is it not true that people 
              are publicly and systematically taught that it is the height of presumption for any one to say that his sins are all forgiven — that <em>he</em> has eternal life —  
              that he <em>is</em> justified from all things — that he 
              <em>is</em> accepted in the Beloved — that he <em>is</em> sealed with the Holy Ghost — that he cannot be lost, because he is actually united to Christ 
              by the indwelling Spirit? Are not all these Christian privileges practically denied and ignored in Christendom? Are not people taught that it is 
              dangerous to be too confident — that it is morally safer to live in doubt and fear — that the very utmost we can look for is the hope of getting to heaven 
              when we die? Where are souls taught the glorious truths connected with the new creation? Where are they rooted and grounded in the knowledge of their 
              standing in a risen and glorified Head in the heavens? 
              Where are they led into the enjoyment of those things which are freely given of God to His beloved people? 
          </p>

          <p>
              Alas! alas! we grieve to think of the only true answer which can be given to such inquiries. The flock of Christ is scattered upon the dark 
              mountains and desolate moors. The souls of God's people are left in the dim distance which characterised the Jewish system. They know not the 
              meaning of the rent veil, of nearness to God, of conscious acceptance in the Beloved. The very table of the Lord is shrouded with the dark and 
              chilling mists of superstition, and surrounded by the repulsive barriers of a dark and depressing legality. Accomplished redemption, full 
              remission of sins, perfect justification before God, acceptance in a risen Christ, the Spirit of adoption, the bright and blessed hope of the 
              coming of the Bridegroom — all these grand and glorious realities — these chartered privileges of the Church of God — are practically set aside 
              by Christendom's teachings and religious machinery.
          </p>

          <p>
              Some, perhaps, may think we have drawn too gloomy a picture. We can only say — and we say it with all sincerity — would to God it were so! We 
              fear the picture is far too true; yea, the reality is far more appalling than the picture. We are deeply and painfully impressed with the fact, 
              that the condition, not merely of the professing church, but of thousands of the true sheep of the flock of Christ, is such, that if we only 
              realised it as God sees it, it would break our hearts.

          <h2>Peace with God and for our conscience is gained through faith
            </h2>
          <p>
            Now this must give peace to the conscience, if only it be received in the simplicity of faith. How is it possible for a person to believe that 
            God has satisfied Himself as to his sins, and not have peace? If God says to us, <b>"Your sins and iniquities I will remember no more,"</b> what could 
            we desire further as a basis of peace for our conscience? If God assures me that all my sins are blotted out as a thick; cloud — that they are 
            cast behind His back — for ever gone from His sight — should I not have peace? If He shows me the man who bore my sins on the cross, now crowned 
            at the right hand of the Majesty in the heavens, ought not my soul to enter into perfect rest as to the question of my sins? Most assuredly.
          </p>

          <p>
            For how, let me ask, did Christ reach the place which He now fills on the throne of God? Was it as God over all, blessed for ever? No; for He was 
            always that. Was it as the eternal Son of the Father? No; He was ever that — ever in the bosom of the Father — the object of the Father's eternal 
            and ineffable delight. Was it as a spotless, holy, perfect Man, whose nature was absolutely pure, perfectly free from sin? No; for in that 
            character, and on that ground, He could at any moment, between the manger and the cross, have claimed a place at the right hand of God. How was it 
            then? Eternal praise to the God of all grace! it was as the One who had by His death accomplished the glorious work of redemption — the One who had 
            stood charged with the full weight of our sins — the One who had perfectly satisfied all the righteous claims of that throne on which He now sits.
          </p>

          <p>
            This is a grand, cardinal point for the anxious reader to seize. It cannot fail to emancipate the heart, and tranquilize the conscience. We cannot 
            possibly behold by faith the Man who was nailed to the tree, now crowned on the throne, and not have peace with God. The Lord Jesus Christ, having 
            taken upon Himself our sins, and the judgment due to them, He could not be where He now is if a single one of those sins remained unatoned for. To 
            see the sin-bearer crowned with glory is to see our sins gone for ever from the divine presence. Where are our sins? They are all obliterated. How 
            do we know this? The One who took them all upon Himself has passed through the heavens to the very highest pinnacle of glory. Eternal justice has 
            wreathed His blessed brow with a diadem of glory, as the Accomplisher of our redemption — the Bearer of our sins; thus proving, beyond all question, 
            or possibility of a question, that our sins are all put away out of God's sight for ever. A crowned Christ, and a clear conscience, are, in the 
            blessed economy of grace, inseparably linked together. Wondrous fact! Well may we chant with all our ransomed powers the praises of redeeming love.
          </p>

          <p>
            But let us see how this most consolatory truth is set forth in holy scripture. In Romans 3 we read, <b>"But now the righteousness of God, without law 
            [coris nomou], is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets; even the righteousness of God, by faith of Jesus Christ, to all and upon 
            all them that believe: for there is no difference: for all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; being justified freely by his grace, 
            through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: <em>whom God has set forth</em> a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for 
            the remission [or passing over] of sins that are past </b>[in time gone by]<b>, through the forbearance of God; to declare at this time his righteousness; 
            that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believes in Jesus."</b>

          </p>

          
          <p>
            Again, in Romans 4, speaking of Abraham's faith being counted to him for righteousness, the apostle adds, <b>"Now it was not written for his sake 
              alone, that it was imputed to him: but for as also to whom it shall be imputed, if <em>we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from 
              the dead; who was delivered for our offences, and raised again for our justification."</em></b>   Here we have God introduced to our souls as the One 
              who raised from the dead the Bearer of our sins. Why did He do so? Because the One who had been delivered for our offences had perfectly glorified 
              Him respecting those offences, and put them away for ever. God not only sent His only begotten Son into the world, but He bruised Him for our 
              iniquities, and raised Him from the dead, in order that we might know and believe that our iniquities are all disposed of in such a manner as 
              to glorify Him infinitely and everlastingly. Eternal and universal homage to His name!

          </p>

        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>The Lord would not sit down in rest unless His atoning work was complete and sufficient</h2>

          <p>
            But we have farther testimony on this grand fundamental truth. In Hebrews 1 we read such soul-stirring words as these: <b>"God, who at sundry 
              times and in divers manners</b> [or in divers measures and modes] <b>spake in times past to the fathers by the prophets, has in these last days spoken 
              to us by [His] Son, whom he has appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds; who being the brightness of his glory, and the 
              express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, <em>when he had by himself purged our sins</em> sat down on the right 
              hand of the Majesty on high."</b>  Our Lord Christ, blessed be His name, would not take His seat on the throne of God, until he had, by the offering 
              of Himself on the cross, purged our sins. Hence a risen Christ at God's right hand is the glorious and unanswerable proof that our sins are all 
              gone, for He could not be where He now is if a single one of those sins remained. God raised from the dead the self-same Man on whom He Himself 
              had laid the full weight of our sins. Thus all is settled — divinely, eternally settled. It is as impossible that a single sin can be found on 
              the very weakest believer in Jesus, as on Jesus Himself. This is a wonderful thing to be able to say, but it is the solid truth of God, 
              established in manifold places in holy scripture; and the soul that believes it must possess a peace which the world can neither give nor 
              take away.
