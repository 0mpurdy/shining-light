          <p>
              Having, in the three preceding papers of this series, sought to unfold the grand foundation truths connected with the work of Christ for us — 
              His work in the past, and His work in the present — His atonement, and His advocacy; we shall now seek, by the gracious aid of the Spirit of God, 
              to present to the reader something of what the Scriptures teach us as to the second branch of our subject, namely, <em>Christ as an object for our 
              heart.</em>

          </p>

        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>Christ as the central and only object of our heart’s affections and desires</h2>
          <p>
              It is a wonderfully blessed thing to be able to say, "I have found an object which perfectly satisfies my heart — I have found Christ." It is 
              this which gives true elevation above the world. It renders us thoroughly independent of the resources to which the unconverted heart ever 
              betakes itself. It gives settled rest. It imparts a calmness and quietness to the spirit which the world cannot comprehend. The poor votary 
              of the world may think the life of the true Christian a very slow, dull, stupid affair indeed. He may marvel how such an one can manage to 
              get on without what he calls amusement, recreation, and pleasure; no theatres — no balls or parties — no concerts — no cards or billiards — 
              no hunts or races — no club or news-room — no cricket or croquet parties.
          </p>

          <p>
              To deprive the unconverted man of such things would almost drive him to despair or lunacy. But the Christian does not want such things, 
              would not have them. They would be a perfect weariness to him. We speak, of course, of the true Christian, of one who is not merely a 
              Christian in name but in reality. Alas! alas! many profess to be Christians, and take very high ground in their profession, who are, 
              nevertheless to be found mixed up in all the vain and frivolous pursuits of the men of this world. They may be seen at the communion 
              table on the Lord's Day and at a theatre or a concert on Monday. They may be found assaying to take part in some one or other of the 
              many branches of Christian work on Sunday, and, during the week, you may see them in the ball-room, at the race-course, or some such 
              scene of folly and vanity.
          </p>

          <p>
              It is very evident that such persons know nothing of Christ as an object for the heart. Indeed, it is very questionable how any one with a 
              single spark of divine life in the soul can find pleasure in the wretched pursuits of a godless world. The true and earnest Christian turns 
              away from such things — turns away instinctively. And this, not merely because of the positive wrong and evil of them — though most surely 
              he feels them to be wrong and evil — but because he has no taste for them, and because he has found something infinitely superior, something 
              which perfectly satisfies all the desires of the new nature. Could we imagine an angel from heaven taking pleasure at a ball, a theatre, or a 
              racecourse? The bare thought is supremely ridiculous. All such scenes are perfectly foreign to a heavenly being.
          </p>

          <p>
            And what is a Christian? He is a heavenly man; he is a partaker of the divine nature. He is dead to the world — dead to sin — alive to God. He has 
            not a single link with the world. He belongs to heaven. He is no more of the world than Christ his Lord. Could Christ take part in the amusements, 
            gaieties, and follies of the world? The very idea were blasphemy. Well, then, what of the Christian? Is he to be found where his Lord could not be? 
            Can he consistently take part in things which he knows in his heart are contrary to Christ? Can he go into places, and scenes, and circumstances in 
            which he must admit his Saviour and Lord can take no part? Can he go and have fellowship with a world which hates the One to whom he professes to owe 
            everything?
          </p>
          
          
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>Being in the world, but not of it ...</h2>
          <p>
              It may, perhaps, seem to some of our readers that we are taking too high ground. We would ask such, what ground are we to take? Surely Christian 
              ground, if we are Christians. Well, then, if we are to take Christian ground, how are we to know what that ground really is? Assuredly from the 
              New Testament. And what does it teach? Does it afford any warrant for the Christian to mix himself, in any shape or form, with the amusements and 
              vain pursuits of this present evil world? Let us hearken to the weighty words of our blessed Lord, in John 13. Let us hear from His lips the truth 
              as to our portion, our position, and our path in this world. He says, addressing the Father, <b>"I have given them thy word; and the world has hated them, 
                <em>because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</em> I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep 
                them from the evil. <em>They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</em> Sanctify them through thy truth; thy word is truth. As thou hast sent me 
                into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world."  (John 13:14-18).</b>
          </p>
         
          <p>
              Is it possible to conceive a closer measure of identification than that set before us in these words? Twice over, in this brief passage, our 
              Lord declares that we are not of the world, even as He is not. What has our blessed Lord to do with the world? Nothing. The world has utterly 
              rejected Him, and cast Him out. It nailed Him to a shameful cross, between two malefactors. The world lies as fully and as freshly under the 
              charge of all this, as though the act of the crucifixion took place yesterday, at the very centre of its civilisation, and with the unanimous 
              consent of all. There is not so much as a single moral link between Christ and the world. Yea, the world is stained with His murder, and will 
              have to answer to God for the crime.
          </p>

          <p>
              How solemn is this! What a serious consideration for Christians! We are passing through a world that crucified our Lord and Master, and He 
              declares that we are not of that world, even as He is not of it. Hence it follows that in so far as we have any fellowship with the world, 
              We are false to Christ. What should we think of a wife who could sit, and laugh and joke, with a set of men who had murdered her husband? And 
              yet this is precisely what professing Christians do when they mix themselves up with this present evil world, and make themselves part and 
              parcel of it.
          </p>
     

        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>How do we live in the world but not be of it?</h2>
          <p>
              It will perhaps be said, "What are we to do? Are we to go out of the world?" By no means. Our Lord expressly says, <b>"I pray not that thou 
              shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil."</b> In it, but not of it, is the true principle for the 
              Christian. To use a figure, the Christian in the world is like a diver. He is in the midst of an element which would destroy him, were he not 
              protected from its action, and sustained by unbroken communication with the scene above. And what is the Christian to do in the world? What is 
              his mission? Here it is: <b>“As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I sent them into the world."</b> And again, in John 20:21, <b>"As my Father 
              has sent me, even so I send you."</b>

          </p>

          <p>
              Such is the Christian's mission. He is not to shut himself within the walls of a monastery or convent. Christianity does not consist in joining 
              a brotherhood or a sisterhood. Nothing of the kind. We are called to move up and down in the varied relations of life, and to act in our 
              divinely-appointed spheres to the glory of God. It is not a question of what we are doing, but of how we do it. All depends upon the object 
              which governs our hearts. If Christ be the commanding and absorbing object of the heart, all will be right. If He be not, nothing is right. 
              Two persons may sit down at the same table to eat; the one eats to gratify his appetite, the other eats to the glory of God — eats simply to 
              keep his body in proper working order as God's vessel, the temple of the Holy Ghost, the instrument for Christ's service.
          </p>

          <p>
            So in everything. It is our sweet privilege to set the Lord always before us. He is our model. As He was sent into the world, so are we. What did 
            He come to do? To glorify God. How did He live? By the Father. <b>"As the living Father has sent me, and I live by the Father, so he that eats me, 
            even he shall live by me." (John 6:57).</b>
          </p>

          <p>
            This makes it all so simple. Christ is the standard and touchstone for everything. It is no longer a question of mere right and wrong according to 
            human rules. It is simply a question of what is worthy of Christ. Would He do this or that? Would He go here or there? <b>"He left us an example that 
            we should follow <em>His</em> steps;"</b> and, most assuredly, we should not go where we cannot trace His blessed footsteps. If we go hither and thither to 
            please ourselves, we are not treading in His steps, and we cannot expect to enjoy His blessed presence.
          </p>

          <p>
              Christian reader, here is the real secret of the whole matter. The grand question is just this — Is Christ my one object? What am I living for? 
              Can I say, <b>"The life that I live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me?"</b> Nothing less than 
              this is worthy of a Christian. It is a poor miserable thing to be content with being saved, and then to go on with the world, and live for self-pleasing 
              and self-interest — to accept salvation as the fruit of Christ's toil and passion, and then live at a distance from Himself. What should we think of a 
              child who only cared about the good things provided by his father's hand, and never sought his father's company — yea, preferred the company of strangers? 
              We should justly despise him But how much more despicable is the Christian, who owes his present and his eternal all to the work of Christ, and yet is 
              content to live at a cold distance from His blessed Person, caring not for the furtherance of His cause — the promotion of His glory!
