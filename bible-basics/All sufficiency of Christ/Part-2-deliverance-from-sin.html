          <h2>Entire Deliverance from the Present Power of Sin</h2>
          <p>
            Thus far, we have been occupied with that aspect of the work of Christ which bears upon the question of the forgiveness of sins; and we earnestly 
            trust that the reader is thoroughly clear and settled on this grand point. It is assuredly his happy privilege so to be, if only he will take God 
            at His word. <b>"For Christ also has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God." (1 Peter 3:18).</b>
          </p>

          <p>
            If then Christ has suffered for our sins, should we not know the deep blessedness of being eternally delivered from the burden of those sins? Can it be 
            according to the mind and heart of God that one for whom Christ suffered should remain in perpetual bondage, tied and bound with the chain of his 
            sins, and crying out from week to week, month to month, and year to year, that the burden of his sins is intolerable?
          </p>

          <p>
            If such utterances are true and proper for the Christian, then what has Christ done for us? Can it be true that Christ has put away our sins, and 
            yet that we are tied and bound with the chain of them? Is it true that He bore the heavy burden of our sins, and yet that we are still crushed 
            beneath the intolerable weight thereof?
          </p>

          <p>
            Some would fain persuade us that it is not possible to know that our sins are forgiven; that we must go on to the end of our life in a state of 
            complete uncertainty on this most vital and important question. If this be so, what has become of the precious gospel of the grace of God — the 
            glad tidings of salvation? In the view of such miserable teaching as this, what mean those glowing words of the blessed apostle Paul, in the 
            synagogue of Antioch? <b>"Be it known to you, therefore, men and brethren, that through this man</b> [Jesus Christ, dead and risen] <b>is preached</b> [not 
            promised as a future thing, but proclaimed now] <b>the forgiveness of sins; and by him all who believe are</b> [not shall be, or hope to be] <b>justified 
            from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses." (Acts 13:38, 39).</b>
          </p>

          <p>
            If we were resting on the law of Moses, on our keeping the commandments, on our doing our duty, on our feeling as we ought, on our valuing Christ 
            and loving God as we ought, reason would that we should be in doubt and dark uncertainty, seeing we could have no possible ground of assurance. If 
            we had so much as the movement of an eyelash to do in the matter, then verily it would be the very height of presumption on our part to think of 
            being certain.
          </p>

          <p>
            But, on the other hand, when we hear the voice of the living God who cannot lie, proclaiming in our ears the glad tidings that through His own 
            beloved Son who died on the cross, was buried in the grave, raised from the dead, and seated in the glory — that through Him alone — through Him 
            without anything whatever of ours — through His one offering of Himself once and for ever, full and everlasting remission of sins is preached, as 
            a present reality, to be enjoyed now by every soul who simply believes the precious record of God, how is it possible for any one to continue in 
            doubt and uncertainty? Is Christ's work finished? He said it was. What did He do? He put away our sins. Are they then put away, or are they still 
            on us — which?
          </p>

          <p>
            Reader, say which? where are thy sins? Are they blotted out as a thick cloud? or are they still lying as a heavy load of guilt, in condemning power 
            on thy conscience? If they were not put away by the atoning death of Christ, they will never be put away. If He did not bear them on the cross, you 
            will have to bear them in the tormenting flames of hell for ever, and ever, and ever. Yes; be assured of it, there is no other way of disposing of 
            this most weighty and momentous question. If Christ did not settle the matter on the cross, you must settle it in hell. It must be so, if God's word 
            be true.

          <h2>We are brought to God now in the worth of Christ</h2>
          <p>
            But glory be to God, His own testimony assures us that Christ has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God; not 
            merely bring us to heaven when we die, but bring us to God now How does He bring us to God? Tied and bound with the chain of our sins? with an intolerable 
            burden of guilt on our souls? Nay, verily; He brings us to God without spot or stain or charge. He brings us to God in all His own acceptableness. Is there 
            any guilt on Him? No; there was, blessed 			be His name, when He stood in our stead, but it is gone — gone for ever — cast as lead into the unfathomable 
            waters of divine forgetfulness. He was charged with our sins, on the cross. God laid on Him all our iniquities, and dealt with Him about them. The whole 
            question of our sins, according to God's estimate thereof, was fully gone into and definitively, because divinely settled between God and Christ, amid the 
            awful shadows of Calvary. Yes, it was all done, once and for ever there. How do we know it? By the authority of the only true God. His word assures us 
            that we have redemption through the blood of Christ, the remission of sins, according to the riches of His grace. He declares to us, in accents of sweetest, 
            richest, deepest mercy, that our sins and our iniquities He will remember no more. Is not this enough? Shall we still continue to cry out that we are tied 
            and bound with the chain of our sins? Shall we thus cast a slur upon the perfect work of Christ? Shall we thus tarnish the lustre of divine grace and give 
            the lie to the testimony of the Holy Ghost in the scripture of truth? Far be the thought! It must not be so. Let us rather hail with thanksgiving the 
            blessed boon so freely conferred upon us by love divine, through the precious blood of Christ. It is the joy of the heart of God to forgive us our sins, 
            Yes, God delights in pardoning iniquity and transgression. It gratifies and glorifies Him to pour into the broken and contrite heart the precious balm of 
            His, own pardoning love and mercy. He spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up, and bruised Him on the cursed tree, in order that He might be able, in 
            perfect righteousness, to let the rich streams of grace flow forth 
            from His large, loving heart, to the poor, guilty, self-destroyed, conscience-smitten sinner.

        <div class="section">
          <h2>Can I be sure my sins are gone?</h2>
          <p>
            But, should it be, that the reader still feels disposed to inquire how he may have the assurance that this blessed remission of sins — -this fruit 
            of Christ's atoning work, applies to him, let him hearken to those magnificent words which flowed from the lips of the risen Saviour, as He 
            commissioned the earliest heralds of His grace. <b>"And he said to them, Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for Christ to suffer, and 
            to rise from the dead the third day; and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at 
            Jerusalem." (Luke 24:46, 47).</b>

          </p>

          <p>
            Here we have the great and glorious commission — its basis, its authority, its sphere. Christ has suffered. This is the meritorious ground of 
            remission of sins. Without shedding of blood there is no remission of sins. But by the shedding of blood, and by it alone, there is remission of 
            sins — a remission as full and complete as the precious blood of Christ is fitted to effect.

          </p>

          <p>
            But where is the authority? <b>"It is written."</b> Blessed, indisputable authority! Nothing can ever shake it. I know, on the solid authority of the word 
            of God, that my sins are all forgiven, all blotted out, all gone for ever, all cast behind God's back, so that they can never, by any possibility, 
            rise against me.
          </p>

          <p>
            Finally, as to the sphere. It is <b>"all nations."</b> This includes me, beyond all question. There is no sort of exception, condition, or qualification. 
            The blessed tidings were to be wafted, on the wings of love, to all nations — to all the world — to every creature under heaven. How could I exclude 
            myself from this world-wide commission? Do I question, for a moment, that the beams of God's sun are intended for me? Surely not. And why should I 
            question the precious fact that remission of sins is for me? Not for a single instant. It is for me as surely as though I were the only sinner beneath 
            the canopy of God's heaven. The universality of its aspect precludes all question as to its being designed for me.
          </p>

          
          <p>
            And surely if any further encouragement were needed, it is found in the fact that the blessed ambassadors were to "begin at Jerusalem" — the very 
            guiltiest spot on the face of the earth. They were to make the earliest offer of pardon to the very murderers of the Son of God. This the apostle 
            Peter does in those words of marvellous and transcendent grace, <b>'"Unto you first, God having raised up his Son, sent him to bless you, by turning 
            away every one of you from your iniquities." (Acts 3:26).</b>
          </p>

          <p>
            It is not possible to conceive anything richer or fuller, or more magnificent than this. The grace that could reach the murderers of the Son of 
            God, can reach any one. The blood that could cleanse the guilt of such a crime can cleanse the vilest sinner outside the precincts of hell.
          </p>

          <p>
            Anxious reader, do you — can you still hesitate as to the forgiveness of your sins? Christ has suffered for sins. God preaches remission of sins. He 
            pledges His own word on the point. <b>"To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believes in him shall receive remission of sins."</b> 
            What more would you have? How can you any longer doubt or delay? What are you waiting for? You have Christ's finished work and God's faithful word. Surely 
            these ought to satisfy your heart and tranquilize your mind. Do then let us entreat you to accept the full and everlasting remission of all your sins. 
            Receive into your heart the sweet tidings of divine love and mercy, and go on your way rejoicing. Hear the voice of a risen Saviour, speaking from the 
            throne of the majesty in the heavens, and assuring you that your sins are all forgiven. Let those soothing accents from the very mouth of God Himself, 
            fall In their enfranchising power upon your troubled spirit, <b>"Your sins and iniquities will I remember no more."</b> If God thus speaks to me; if He so assures 
            me that He will no more remember my sins, should I not be fully and for ever satisfied? Why should I go on doubting and reasoning when God has spoken? What 
            can give certainty but the word of God that lives and abides for ever? It is the only ground of certainty; and no power of earth or hell, human or 
            diabolical, can ever shake it. The finished work of Christ and the 
            faithful word of God are the basis and the authority of full forgiveness of sins.

          <h2>We are not just saved but have present deliverance from sin in Christ Jesus</h2>

          <p>
            But, blessed for ever be the God of all grace, it is not only remission of sins which is announced to us through the atoning death of Christ. 
            This, in itself, would be a boon and a blessing of the very highest order; and as we have seen, we enjoy it according to the largeness of the 
            heart of God, and according to the value and efficacy of the death of Christ, as God estimates it. But, besides the full and perfect remission 
            of sins, <em>we have also entire deliverance from the present power of sin.</em>

          </p>

          <p>
            This is a grand point for every true lover of holiness. According to the glorious economy of grace, the same work which secures the complete 
            remission of sins has broken for ever the power of sin. It is not only that the sins of the life are blotted out, but the sin of the nature 
            is condemned. The believer is privileged to regard himself as dead to sin. He can sing, with a glad heart,
          </p>

          <p style="text-align:center">
            "For me, Lord Jesus, Thou hast died,
            And I have died in Thee;
            Thou'rt risen, my bands are all untied,
            And now Thou livest in me.
            The Father's face of radiant grace
            Shines now in light on me."
          </p>

          <p>
            This is the proper breathing of a Christian. <b>"I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me."</b> This is 
            Christianity. The old "I "crucified, and Christ living in me. The Christian is a new creation. Old things are passed away. The death of Christ has 
            closed for ever the history of the old "I;" and hence, though sin dwells in the believer, its power is broken and gone for ever. Not only is its 
            guilt cancelled, but it’s terrible dominion completely overthrown. 

          </p>

          <p>
              This is the glorious doctrine of Romans 6-8. The thoughtful student of this most magnificent epistle will observe that, from Rom. 3:21 to Rom. 5:11, 
              we have the work of Christ applied to the question of sins. And, from chapter 5:12 to the end of chapter 8. we have another aspect of that work, namely, 
              its application to the question of sin — "our old man" — "the body of sin" — "sin in the flesh." There is no such thing in scripture as the forgiveness of 
              sin. God has condemned sin, not forgiven it — an immensely important distinction. God has set forth His eternal abhorrence of sin, in the cross of Christ. 
              He has expressed and executed His judgment upon it; and now the believer can see himself as linked and identified with the One who died on the cross, and 
              is raised from the dead. He has passed out of the sphere of sin's dominion into that new and blessed sphere where grace reigns through righteousness. <b>"God 
              be thanked,"</b> says the apostle, <b>"that ye were</b> [once, but now no longer are to be] <b>the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that 
              type of doctrine to which ye were delivered. Being then made free from sin</b> [not merely sins forgiven], <b>ye became the servants of righteousness. I speak 
              after the manner of men, because of the infirmity of your flesh; for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity to iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness, to holiness. For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness. What fruit 
              had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death. But now being made <em>free from sin</em>, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit to holiness, and the end everlasting life." Romans 6:17-22.</b>
          </p>

          <p>
              Here lies the precious secret of holy living. We are dead to sin; alive to God. The reign of sin is over. What has sin to do with a dead man? 
              Nothing. Well, then, the believer has died with Christ; he was buried with Christ; he is risen with Christ, to walk in newness of life. He lives 
              under the precious reign of grace, and he has his fruit to holiness. The man who draws a plea from the abundance of divine grace to live in sin, 
              denies the very foundation of Christianity. <b>"How shall we that have died to sin, live any longer therein?"</b> Impossible. It would be a denial of 
              the whole Christian standing. To imagine the Christian as one who is to go on, from day to day, week to week, month to month, and year to year, 
              sinning and repenting, sinning and repenting, is to degrade Christianity and falsify the whole Christian position. To say that a Christian must 
              go on sinning because he has the flesh in him is to ignore the death of Christ in one of its grand aspects, and to give the lie to the whole of 
              the apostle's teaching in Romans 6-8. Thank God, there is no necessity whatever why the believer should commit sin. <b>"My little children, these 
              things write I to you that ye sin not."</b>   We should not justify ourselves in a single sinful thought. It is our sweet privilege to walk in the 
              light, as God is in the light; and, most surely, when we are walking in the light, we are not committing sin. Alas! we get out of the light and 
              commit sin; but the normal, the true, the divine idea of a Christian is, walking in the light, and not committing sin. A sinful thought is 
              foreign to the true genius of Christianity.

          </p>

          <p>
              We have sin in us, and shall have it so long as we are in the body: but if we walk in the Spirit, the sin in our nature will not show itself in 
              the life. <em>To say that we need not sin, is to state a Christian privilege; to say that we cannot sin is a deceit and a delusion.</em>
