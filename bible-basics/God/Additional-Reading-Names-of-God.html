        <h1>Additional Reading: Names of God</h1>
        

        <div class="section">
          <h2><b>EL, ELOAH [el, el-oh-ah]:</b></h2>
          <p>
              God "mighty, strong, prominent" (Nehemiah 9:17; Psalm 139:19) – etymologically, El appears to mean 
              “power” and “might” (Genesis 31:29). El is associated with other qualities, such as integrity (Numbers 23:19), jealousy (Deuteronomy 5:9), 
              and compassion (Nehemiah 9:31), but the root idea of “might” remains.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2><b>ELOHIM [el-oh-heem]:</b></h2>
            <p>
                God “Creator, Mighty and Strong” (Genesis 17:7; Jeremiah 31:33) – the plural form of Eloah, which accommodates the doctrine of the Trinity. From 
                the Bible’s first sentence, the superlative nature of God’s power is evident as God (Elohim) speaks the world into existence (Genesis 1:1).
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><b>EL SHADDAI [el-shah-dahy]:</b></h2>
            <p>
                 “God Almighty,” “The Mighty One of Jacob” (Genesis 49:24; Psalm 132:2,5) – speaks to God’s ultimate power over all.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><b>ADONAI [ˌædɒˈnaɪ; ah-daw-nahy]:</b></h2>
            <p>
                “Lord” (Genesis 15:2; Judges 6:15) – used in place of YHWH, which was thought by the Jews to be too sacred to be uttered by sinful men. 
                In the Old Testament, YHWH is more often used in God’s dealings with His people, while Adonai is used more when He deals with the Gentiles.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><b>YHWH / YAHWEH / JEHOVAH [yah-way / ji-hoh-veh]:</b></h2>
            <p>
                “LORD” (Deuteronomy 6:4; Daniel 9:14) – strictly speaking, the only proper name for God. Translated in English Bibles “LORD” (all capitals) to distinguish it from Adonai, “Lord.” The revelation of the name is first given to Moses “I Am who I Am” (Exodus 3:14). This name specifies an immediacy, a presence. 
                Yahweh is present, accessible, near to those who call on Him for deliverance (Psalm 107:13), forgiveness (Psalm 25:11) and guidance (Psalm 31:3).
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><b>YAHWEH-JIREH [yah-way-ji-reh]:</b></h2>
            <p>
                "The Lord Will Provide" (Genesis 22:14) – the name memorialized by Abraham when God provided the ram to be sacrificed in place of Isaac.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><b>YAHWEH-RAPHA [yah-way-raw-faw]:</b></h2>
            <p>
            "The Lord Who Heals" (Exodus 15:26) – “I am Jehovah who heals you” both in body and soul. In body, by preserving from and curing diseases, 
            and in soul, by pardoning iniquities.

            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><b>YAHWEH-NISSI [yah-way-nee-see]:</b></h2>
            <p>
               "The Lord Our Banner" (Exodus 17:15), where banner is understood to be a rallying place. This name commemorates the desert victory over the Amalekites in Exodus 17.

            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><b>YAHWEH-M'KADDESH [yah-way-meh-kad-esh]:</b></h2>
            <p>
              "The Lord Who Sanctifies, Makes Holy" (Leviticus 20:8; Ezekiel 37:28) – God makes it clear that He alone, not the law, can cleanse His people and make them holy.

            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><b>YAHWEH-SHALOM [yah-way-shah-lohm]:</b></h2>
            <p>
              "The Lord Our Peace" (Judges 6:24) – the name given by Gideon to the altar he built after the Angel of the Lord assured him he would not die as he thought he would after seeing Him.

            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><b>YAHWEH-ELOHIM [yah-way-el-oh-him]:</b></h2>
            <p>
              "LORD God" (Genesis 2:4; Psalm 59:5) – a combination of God’s unique name YHWH and the generic “Lord,” signifying that He is the Lord of Lords.

            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><b>YAHWEH-TSIDKENU [yah-way-tzid-kay-noo]:</b></h2>
            <p>
              "The Lord Our Righteousness” (Jeremiah 33:16) – As with YHWH-M’Kaddesh, it is God alone who provides righteousness (from the Hebrew word 
              tsidkenu) to man, ultimately in the person of His Son, Jesus Christ, who became sin for us “that we might become the Righteousness of 
              God in Him” (2 Corinthians 5:21).

            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><b>"YAHWEH-ROHI [yah-way-roh-hee]:</b></h2>
            <p>
              "The Lord Our Shepherd" (Psalm 23:1) – After David pondered his relationship as a shepherd to his sheep, he realized that was exactly 
              the relationship God had with him, and so he declares, “Yahweh-Rohi is my Shepherd. I shall not want” (Psalm 23:1).

            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><b>YAHWEH-SHAMMAH [yah-way-sham-mahw]:</b></h2>
            <p>
                "The Lord Is There” (Ezekiel 48:35) – the name ascribed to Jerusalem and the Temple there, indicating that the once-departed glory 
                of the Lord (Ezekiel 8—11) had returned (Ezekiel 44:1-4).

            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><b>YAHWEH-SABAOTH [yah-way-sah-bah-ohth]:</b></h2>
            <p>
                "The Lord of Hosts" (Isaiah 1:24; Psalm 46:7) – Hosts means “hordes,” both of angels and of men. He is Lord of the host of heaven and 
                of the inhabitants of the earth, of Jews and Gentiles, of rich and poor, master and slave. The 
                name is expressive of the majesty, power, and authority of God and shows that He is able to accomplish what He determines to do.

            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><b>EL ELYON [el-el-yohn]:</b></h2>
            <p>
               “Most High" (Deuteronomy 26:19) – derived from the Hebrew root for “go up” or “ascend,” so the implication is 
                of that which is the very highest. El Elyon denotes exaltation and speaks of absolute right to lordship.

            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><b>EL ROI [el-roh-ee]:</b></h2>
            <p>
             "God of Seeing" (Genesis 16:13) – the name ascribed to God by Hagar, alone and desperate in the wilderness after being driven 
             out by Sarah (Genesis 16:1-14). When Hagar met the Angel of the Lord, she realized she had seen God Himself in a theophany. She 
             also realized that El Roi saw her in her distress and testified that He is a God who lives and sees all.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><b>EL-OLAM [el-oh-lahm]:</b></h2>
            <p>
               "Everlasting God" (Psalm 90:1-3) – God’s nature is without beginning or end, free from all constraints of time, and He contains within 
               Himself the very cause of time itself. “From everlasting to everlasting, You are God.”
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2><b>EL-GIBHOR [el-ghee-bohr]:</b></h2>
            <p>
             “Mighty God” (Isaiah 9:6) – the name describing the Messiah, Christ Jesus, in this prophetic portion of Isaiah. As a powerful and 
             mighty warrior, the Messiah, the Mighty God, will accomplish the destruction of God’s enemies and rule with a rod of iron (Revelation 19:15).
