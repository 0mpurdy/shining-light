                As part of a series of studiess on “The Future” this paper looks at the future for the Church/Assembly.  It is linked with the other studies in 
                the series.  It is also worth reading before the study on “The Christian Hope and Expectation”.

            <h2>Where is the Church/Assembly in prophecy?</h2>
          
            <p>
                Much of the Old Testament is taken up with the future for Israel.  Even when the Lord Jesus was here and spoke of the future, He was speaking 
                to Jews and described the experience of Israel.  It was all that the disciples would understand.  However, after the Lord was raised, the 
                disciples realised that they were now part of something completely new.

            </p>

            <p>
                Someone has described the present day of grace, during which the Church/Assembly is being formed, as a parenthesis in the history of God’s 
                interaction with mankind.  In other words, the whole of the last two thousand years is not really mentioned in prophecy because it hasn’t had 
                anything to do with Israel.  Yet it is implied in so many ways.  Two examples are given below:
            </p>

            <p class="scripture">
                “Kings' daughters are among thine honourable women; upon thy right hand doth stand the queen in gold of Ophir” (Psalm 45:9).

            </p>

            <p class="scripture">
                “And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnath-paaneah, and gave him as wife Asnath the daughter of Potipherah the priest in On. And Joseph went 
                out over the land of Egypt” (Genesis 41:45).
            </p>

           
            <p>
                In each of these the one who is being described is a beautiful picture of the Lord Jesus in His glory.  The queen or wife that they have is not 
                mentioned much but she is there with them.  This is a picture of the Church who will be one with Christ.  This ties in with the picture of the 
                Church/Assembly as being the ‘bride of Christ’ (see Revelation 21 and 22).
            </p>

            <p>
              Another example is not made clear until Peter uses it on the day of Pentecost referring to the fact that the Holy Spirit has been sent <b>“And it 
                shall be in the last days, saith God, that I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and 
                your young men shall see visions, and your elders shall dream with dreams; yea, even upon my bondmen and upon my bondwomen in those days will 
                I pour out of my Spirit, and they shall prophesy” (Acts 2:17-18)</b>. This was quoted from the prophet Joel 2:28-29 and so we see that the day 
                for this pouring out of the spirit has arrived.  This makes the Church distinct from other time periods because the Holy Spirit for the first 
                time now dwelt within believers.  The Lord Jesus referred to the distinctiveness of the kingdom He was introducing when he said that John the 
                Baptist was the greatest of the prophets and yet <b>“he who is a little one in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he” (Matthew 11:11)</b>.
            </p>

            <p>
                So, in the prophecy of Daniel 9 (see ‘The Lord in Prophecy’) the church period began when the Messiah was cut off after week 69 and this has 
                included the last two thousand years.

              <h2>What happens next?</h2>
              <p>
                  There is a lot of misunderstanding about what the Church/Assembly is to experience next.  Let’s look at the Coming of Lord a little more 
                  closely.  We have seen the Lord’s very public ‘Appearing’ in glory to judge the nations and save Israel.  Yet, the Bible seems to tell us 
                  that something very different is to be expected by Christians.  The Bible speaks of one Coming of the Lord but then seems to split this into 
                  two distinct events as shown in the table below:
              </p>

<br>
              <p>
                  These are obviously two separate events.  However, there can be disagreement over when they will take place.  The coming of Christ for the 
                  saints is referred to by some as ‘The Rapture’.  The word "rapture", comes from the Latin and Old French and means to seize or snatch away - 
                  hence its application to the hope of the Church!  In modern times it means to be in a state of absolute delight and so in both senses of 
                  the word it is a fitting title for the most hoped for event in the Church/Assembly.
              </p>

              <p>
                  How do we know when this event will take place?  In Thessalonica there was a very committed and faithful church/assembly.  They were looking 
                  forward to the Lord’s coming and were bright in their faith.  However, when some of their number died they began to be afraid that these 
                  would miss out on ‘The Rapture’.  Paul puts that to rest by telling them that the dead in Christ will rise first and then the living would 
                  go up with them to be with the Lord for ever.
              </p>

              <p class="scripture">
                  “For this we say to you in the word of the Lord, that we, the living, who remain to the coming of the Lord, are in no way to anticipate those 
                  who have fallen asleep; for the Lord himself, with an assembling shout, with archangel's voice and with trump of God, shall descend from 
                  heaven; and the dead in Christ shall rise first; then we, the living who remain, shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to 
                  meet the Lord in the air; and thus we shall be always with the Lord” (1 Thessalonians 4:15-17).
              </p>

              <p>
                  When this happens is shown in 2 Thessalonians.  Before the Lord comes to judge the nations there will be the ‘man of sin’.  Daniel’s vision 
                  describes this person as a small horn who will rule over the beast that represents the Roman Empire.  This seems to indicate that out of the 
                  nations of Europe will appear a political entity that resembles the power and character of the Roman Empire which disintegrated about 1500 
                  years ago.  The leader who controls this confederacy of nations will, after making a peace deal with Israel, will then invade Israel to 
                  attack Jerusalem.
              </p>

              <p>
                  However, this ‘man of sin’ will not be revealed until “he that restrains” is taken away.
              </p>

              <p class="scripture">
                  “Let not any one deceive you in any manner, because it will not be unless the apostasy have first come, and the man of sin have been 
                  revealed, the son of perdition; who opposes and exalts himself on high against all called God, or object of veneration; so that he himself 
                  sits down in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God. Do ye not remember that, being yet with you, I said these things to you? And 
                  now ye know that which restrains, that he should be revealed in his own time. For the mystery of lawlessness already works; only there is 
                  he who restrains now until he be gone, and then the lawless one shall be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus shall consume with the breath of his 
                  mouth, and shall annul by the appearing of his coming; whose coming is according to the working of Satan in all power and signs and wonders 
                  of falsehood” (2 Thessalonians 1:3-9).
              </p>

              <p>
                  In 2 Thessalonians, Paul was writing to reassure the Christians.  Some had been teaching them that the persecution was so fierce against 
                  them that they were now in the ‘Day of the Lord’, i.e. the time of great judgement and suffering before the very public judgement of the 
                  nations by the Lord Jesus.  Paul wrote to tell them that the ‘man of sin’ had to appear before the ‘Day of the Lord’.  In other words, the 
                  judgement would not begin until this leader had appeared who would resist God and who would gather the armies of the nations to Jerusalem 
                  to fight the Lord.  This man will not appear until “he that restrains” is taken away.
              </p>

              <p>
                  So, who is he that restrains?  Paul tells them that they know what and who restrains.  The one who restrains is the Holy Spirit indwelling 
                  the Church/Assembly.  We are told that the Church/Assembly will resist evil and act as a preservative against evil in the power of the Holy 
                  Spirit.  See below for examples:
              </p>

              <p>
                  <b>“Ye are the salt of the earth; but if the salt have become insipid, wherewith shall it be salted? It is no longer fit for anything but to 
                  be cast out and to be trodden under foot by men” (Matthew 5:13).</b>  Salt kills and prevents food from going off.  So we, as filled by the 
                  Holy Spirit, act as restraining influence on the world around us.
              </p>

              <p class="scripture">
                  “For I will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your opposers shall not be able to reply to or resist” (Luke 21:15).
              </p>

              <p class="scripture">
                  “And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the Spirit with which he spoke” (Acts 6:10).
              </p>

              <p class="scripture">
                  “Subject yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you” (James 4:7).
              </p>

              <p>
                  The ‘man of sin’ under Satan’s influence will not be able to have a free reign over the earth as long as the Church/Assembly 
                  remains.  Therefore, the Holy Spirit must be taken away and the Church, as indwelt by the Holy Spirit will go with Him.
              </p>

              <p>
                  This shows that the ‘rapture’ must happen before the seven years of Daniel’s final week begins.  The next great event for the Christians 
                  is seeing the Lord.  In the “twinkling of an eye” we shall go from this world and find ourselves before the Lord to be with Him forever.
