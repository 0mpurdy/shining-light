                As part of a series of studiess on “The Future” this paper looks at the future for the Church/Assembly.  It is linked with the other studies in 
                the series.  It is also worth reading before the study on “The Christian Hope and Expectation”.

            <h2>Where is the Church/Assembly in prophecy?</h2>
          
            <p>
                Much of the Old Testament is taken up with the future for Israel.  Even when the Lord Jesus was here and spoke of the future, He was speaking 
                to Jews and described the experience of Israel.  It was all that the disciples would understand.  However, after the Lord was raised, the 
                disciples realised that they were now part of something completely new.

            </p>

            <p>
                Someone has described the present day of grace, during which the Church/Assembly is being formed, as a parenthesis in the history of God’s 
                interaction with mankind.  In other words, the whole of the last two thousand years is not really mentioned in prophecy because it hasn’t had 
                anything to do with Israel.  Yet it is implied in so many ways.  Two examples are given below:
            </p>

            <p class="scripture">
                “Kings' daughters are among thine honourable women; upon thy right hand doth stand the queen in gold of Ophir” (Psalm 45:9).

            </p>

            <p class="scripture">
                “And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnath-paaneah, and gave him as wife Asnath the daughter of Potipherah the priest in On. And Joseph went 
                out over the land of Egypt” (Genesis 41:45).
            </p>

           
            <p>
                In each of these the one who is being described is a beautiful picture of the Lord Jesus in His glory.  The queen or wife that they have is not 
                mentioned much but she is there with them.  This is a picture of the Church who will be one with Christ.  This ties in with the picture of the 
                Church/Assembly as being the ‘bride of Christ’ (see Revelation 21 and 22).
            </p>
