            <h2>The Coming of the Lord</h2>
          
            <p>
                Let’s look at the scriptures that speak of the Coming of the Lord.  The list below is not exhaustive but it should be enough to demonstrate 
                that the Lord is coming to publically judge the nations and that He will reign over a kingdom for a thousand years on the earth.
            </p>

          <div class="section">
              <h2>The Lord is coming to judge the nations</h2>
              <p>
                  In the Old Testament God had not revealed the Trinity of Father, Son and Holy Spirit.  It is Jehovah, the Almighty God who was made known 
                  to Israel through His covenant with them that is mentioned.  God will uphold His covenant with Abraham and bless Israel although first God 
                  has said that He will purge Israel and leave a faithful remnant which will be blessed by Him (see Isaiah 1:24-28). In Romans we are told <b>“Not 
                  however as though the word of God had failed; for not all are Israel which are of Israel” (Romans 9:6)</b> meaning that the Israel of faithful 
                  Jews is the true Israel not simply all those who are born as a Jew.
              </p>

              <p>
                  When the Lord Jesus came He made clear who would judge.  Jesus said <b>“For neither does the Father judge any one, but has given all 
                    judgment to the Son” (John 5:22).</b>  The judge of the nations and the judge of everyone will be the Lord.  We find this in Isaiah 33:22 
                    <b>“For Jehovah is our judge” and then in 2 Timothy 4:1 “I testify before God and Christ Jesus, who is about to judge living and dead”.</b>  
                    The Jehovah who will judge the nations in the Old Testament is the same as the Jesus in the New Testament.  They are both the same God 
                    regardless of how He has revealed Himself.
              </p>

              <p>
                  Keeping this in mind let’s see a few scriptures about the coming of the Lord:
              </p>

              <p class="scripture">
                  "Behold, the day cometh for Jehovah, and thy spoil shall be divided in the midst of thee. And I will assemble all the nations against 
                  Jerusalem to battle; and the city shall be taken, and the houses rifled, and the women ravished; and half of the city shall go forth into 
                  captivity; and the rest of the people shall not be cut off from the city. And Jehovah will go forth and fight with those nations, as when 
                  he fought in the day of battle. And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem toward the east, 
                  and the mount of Olives shall cleave in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west,—a very great valley; and half of the mountain 
                  shall remove toward the north, and half of it toward the south. And ye shall flee by the valley of my mountains; for the valley of the 
                  mountains shall reach unto Azal: ye shall even flee, like as ye fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. And 
                  Jehovah my God shall come, and all the holy ones with thee. And it shall come to pass in that day, that there shall not be light; the shining 
                  shall be obscured. And it shall be one day which is known to Jehovah, not day, and not night; and it shall come to pass, at eventide it shall 
                  be light. And it shall come to pass in that day that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem; half of them toward the eastern sea, and half 
                  of them toward the hinder sea: in summer and in winter shall it be. And Jehovah shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall there be one 
                  Jehovah, and his name one” (Zechariah 14v1-9).   
              </p>
              <p>
                  The Lord will come with the holy ones and stand on the Mount of Olives.  He will save the remnant of Israel who will flee through a valley He 
                  makes.  He will fight the nations who have come to attack Jerusalem and destroy them.  This will begin a time of great blessing as He reigns 
                  over the whole earth with Jerusalem as His capital city.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                  <b>“For as the lightning goes forth from the east and shines to the west, so shall be the coming of the Son of man.  For wherever the 
                    carcase is, there will be gathered the eagles. But immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun shall be darkened, and the 
                    moon not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken. And then shall appear the 
                    sign of the Son of man in heaven; and then shall all the tribes of the land lament, and they shall see the Son of man coming on the clouds 
                    of heaven with power and great glory” (Matthew 24v27-30).</b>  The Son of Man (one of the titles the Lord uses for Himself –coming from the 
                    book of Daniel) will come and all the world shall see the glory of His coming.  All the tribes of Israel will lament and weep when they 
                    realise that they crucified their Messiah. This is also seen in Zechariah’s prophecy: <b>“In that day will Jehovah defend the inhabitants of 
                    Jerusalem; and he that stumbleth among them at that day shall be as David; and the house of David as God, as the Angel of Jehovah before 
                    them. And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem. And I will pour 
                    upon the house of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of grace and of supplications; and they shall look on me whom 
                    they pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for an only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in 
                    bitterness for his firstborn” (Zechariah 12:8-10).</b>  The remnant of Israel will be saved from the attacks of the nations and will see the 
                    one they pierced (i.e. the Lord Jesus who is God manifest in flesh).  He will greatly bless the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
              </p>

              <p class="scripture">
                  “Behold, he comes with the clouds, and every eye shall see him, and they which have pierced him, and all the tribes of the land shall wail 
                  because of him. Yea. Amen” (Revelation 1:7).
              </p>

              <p>
                <b>
                    “So that do not judge anything before the time, until the Lord shall come, who shall also both bring to light the hidden things of 
                    darkness, and shall make manifest the counsels of hearts; and then shall each have his praise from God” (1 Corinthians 4:5).</b>  The 
                    Lord will expose the hidden things of hearts and will judge in truth.
              </p>

              <p class="scripture">
                  “And Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied also as to these, saying, Behold, the Lord has come amidst his holy myriads, to execute 
                  judgment against all; and to convict all the ungodly of them of all their works of ungodliness, which they have wrought ungodlily, and of 
                  all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken against him” (Jude v14-15).
              </p>

              <p class="scripture">
                  "And I saw the heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and one sitting on it, called Faithful and True, and he judges and makes war in 
                  righteousness. And his eyes are a flame of fire, and upon his head many diadems, having a name written which no one knows but himself; and 
                  he is clothed with a garment dipped in blood; and his name is called The Word of God. And the armies which are in the heaven followed him 
                  upon white horses, clad in white, pure, fine linen. And out of his mouth goes a sharp two-edged sword, that with it he might smite the 
                  nations; and he shall shepherd them with an iron rod; and he treads the wine-press of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty. And he has 
                  upon his garment, and upon his thigh, a name written, King of kings, and Lord of lords. And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried 
                  with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in mid-heaven, Come, gather yourselves to the great supper of God, that ye may eat flesh 
                  of kings, and flesh of chiliarchs, and flesh of strong men, and flesh of horses and of those that sit upon them, and flesh of all, both free 
                  and bond, and small and great. And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war against him that 
                  sat upon the horse, and against his army. And the beast was taken, and the false prophet that was with him, who wrought the signs before him by 
                  which he deceived them that received the mark of the beast, and those that worship his image. Alive were both cast into the lake of fire which 
                  burns with brimstone; and the rest were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which goes out of his mouth; and all the birds were 
                  filled with their flesh” (Revelation 19v11-21).  
              </p>

              <p>
                  The Lord, who is King of kings and Lord of lords will come.  The beast (a political leader) will have gathered huge armies to Jerusalem to attack 
                  it and then fight the Lord but the armies will be destroyed by the word of His mouth.
              </p>

              <p>
                  There are many references to the ‘Day of the Lord’ in the Old Testament.  This ‘Day’ is not necessarily one 24-hour day though it does 
                  sometimes refer to that.  It is used in the sense that we might say that the 19th century was the day of Britain’s glory or the last 2000 
                  years have made up the day of God’s mercy and grace to mankind.  The description of this day of the display of God’s righteousness in judging 
                  the nations that have opposed Him for so long is graphic.  No illusion of leniency is given and therefore the urgency of the need of mankind 
                  to make peace with God in this day of grace.
              </p>

              <p class="scripture">
                  “Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, from before the terror of Jehovah, and from the glory of his majesty. The lofty eyes of man 
                  shall be brought low, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and Jehovah alone shall be exalted in that day. For there shall be a 
                  day of Jehovah of hosts upon everything proud and lofty, and upon everything lifted up, and it shall be brought low” (Isaiah 2v10-22).
              </p>

              <p>
                <b>“For behold, Jehovah cometh out of his place to visit the iniquity of the inhabitants of the earth upon them; and the earth shall disclose 
                  her blood, and shall no more cover her slain. In that day Jehovah, with his sore and great and strong sword, will visit leviathan the 
                  fleeing serpent, and leviathan the crooked serpent; and he will slay the monster that is in the sea” (Isaiah 26v21-27v1).</b> The Lord comes 
                  to punish the nations and the dragon (i.e. Satan: see Genesis 3 and Revelation 12:9 & 20:2).  The sea in prophecy is often used as a picture 
                  of the constant shifting and churning of the nations.
              </p>

              <p>
                <b>“And it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search Jerusalem with lamps, and punish the men that are settled on their lees, that 
                  say in their heart, Jehovah will not do good, neither will he do evil. And their wealth shall become a booty, and their houses a desolation; 
                  and they shall build houses, and not inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and not drink the wine thereof. The great day of Jehovah 
                  is near, it is near, and hasteth greatly. The voice of the day of Jehovah: the mighty man shall cry there bitterly. That day is a day of wrath, 
                  a day of trouble and distress, a day of ruin and desolation, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and gross darkness, a day of the 
                  trumpet and alarm, against the fenced cities and against the high battlements. And I will bring distress upon men, and they shall walk like 
                  blind men; for they have sinned against Jehovah; and their blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh as dung: their silver and their 
                  gold shall not be able to deliver them, in the day of Jehovah's wrath; but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy: for a 
                  full end, yea, a sudden [end], shall he make of all them that dwell in the land” (Zephaniah 1v12-18).</b> The Jews will face great suffering 
                  and tribulation as God purges them of the unfaithful and proud when He will judge the idolatrous nations. 
              </p>

              <p>
                  All these scriptures show that the coming of the Lord in His glory will be for the judgement of the nations and for the blessing of the 
                  faithful and repentant remnant of Israel.  It will be the beginning of a kingdom which is unrivalled in peace, prosperity and duration.

              <h2>The Lord will reign as a king on earth</h2>
            
              <p>
                  The prophet Daniel was given the interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar’s dream in Daniel chapter 2.  In his dream Nebuchadnezzar saw a great 
                  statue or image made of different materials.  Each of these materials represented the glory of a world empire.  First, the Babylonian 
                  Empire which Nebuchadnezzar had founded, then the Medo-persian Empire, then the Greek Empire of Alexander the Great, the Roman Empire and 
                  finally the period of many nations, both strong and weak, mixed together.  Lastly there was a stone which was cut out without hands.  This 
                  is a picture of the Lord Jesus who was born as a man but was not descended from Adam’s race of men but rather was a <b>“holy thing”</b>, the son 
                  of God who was born as a result of the Holy Spirit and not the action of a man. <b>“The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and power of the 
                  Highest overshadow thee, wherefore the holy thing also which shall be born shall be called Son of God” (Luke 1:35).</b>  This ‘stone’ grew to 
                  become a great mountain that filled the whole earth.  The kingdom of Christ will rule over all the earth as long as it continues to exist.
              </p>

              <p>
                  Some other scriptures that show that the Lord will reign as king are shown below:
              </p>

              <p class="scripture">
                  “And the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed; for Jehovah of hosts shall reign on mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and before his 
                  ancients in glory” (Isaiah 24:23).
              </p>

              <p>
                <b>“I testify before God and Christ Jesus, who is about to judge living and dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom” (2 Timothy 4v1).</b>  
                The Lord will judge the living and the dead.  He will also appear to the world and have a kingdom.
              </p>

              <p class="scripture">
                  “Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment” (Isaiah 32:1).
              </p>

              <p>
                  <b>“Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, when I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, who shall reign as king, and act wisely, and 
                    shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land” (Jeremiah 23:7).</b>  This is a reference to the fact that the Lord Jesus was born as 
                    being of David’s line, both legally through Joseph and possibly also by birth through Mary’s line.
              </p>

              <p class="scripture">
                  “And the seventh angel sounded his trumpet: and there were great voices in the heaven, saying, The kingdom of the world of our Lord and of 
                  his Christ is come, and he shall reign to the ages of ages” (Revelation 11:15).

                  years had been completed. This is the first resurrection. Blessed and holy he who has part in the first resurrection: over these the second 
                  death has no power; but they shall be priests of God and of the Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years” (Revelation 20:4-6).</b>  
                  The kingdom will last for a thousand years after which this present creation will be removed to make way for the final judgement before the 
                  Great White Throne (see Revelation 21).

                  This appearing in glory will be sudden.  The nations of the world will not be expecting it.  However, we are told that Christians are not 
                  in darkness.  <b>“But concerning the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that ye should be written to, for ye know perfectly 
                  well yourselves, that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief by night. When they may say, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction comes 
                  upon them, as travail upon her that is with child; and they shall in no wise escape. But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that the day 
                  should overtake you as a thief: for all ye are sons of light and sons of day; we are not of night nor of darkness” (1 Thessalonians 5:1-5).</b> 
                  We know what is coming though we have not been given the exact day.  Therefore, the Lord’s coming in glory (i.e. the ‘day of the Lord’) is not 
                  unexpected to the Christian but rather it is something we are looking forward to. <b>“Henceforth the crown of righteousness is laid up for me, 
                  which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will render to me in that day; but not only to me, but also to all who love his appearing” (2 Timothy 4:8).</b>

                    Once everything is subject to Him and all judgement is completed, including the removal of death, the Lord gives everything up to His 
                    Father so that God will be <b>“all in all”</b>.
