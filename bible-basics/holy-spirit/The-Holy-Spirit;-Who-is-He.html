      <h1>The Holy Spirit: Who is He?</h1>
      <div class="wrapped centered">
        <div>
          <p>
            The Holy Spirit is perhaps the most misunderstood person of the Godhead.  Some teach that He is more of a force or an influence than a person.              
          </p>

          <p>
              This study looks more closely at what the Bible actually says about the Holy Spirit (also called the Holy Ghost).  It shows that the Holy Spirit 
              is a divine person who speaks, comforts, has creatorial power and feelings.

          <h2>Who and what is the Holy Spirit?</h2>
          <p class="scripture">
            “God [is] a spirit; and they who worship him must worship [him]
            in spirit and truth.” John 4v24
          </p>

          <p class="scripture">
            “The Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.”
            (Genesis 1v2).  See also Psalm 148v4-5, Revelation 4v11 and
            Colossians 1v16)
          </p>

          <p class="scripture">
            “And the Holy Spirit descended in a bodily form as a dove upon
            him; and a voice came out of heaven, Thou art my beloved Son, in
            thee I have found my delight.” (Luke 3v22)
          </p>

          <p class="scripture">
            “But the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in
            my name, he shall teach you all things, and will bring to your
            remembrance all the things which I have said to you.” (John
            14v26)
          </p>

          <p class="scripture">
            “Go [therefore] and make disciples of all the nations, baptising
            them to the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
            Spirit;” (Matthew 28v19).
          </p>

          <p>
            The Holy Spirit is one of the Trinity and equal in the Godhead.
          </p>
    
          <p class="scripture">
            “And whosoever shall have spoken a word against the Son of man,
            it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever shall speak against the
            Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this age
            nor in the coming [one].” (Matthew 12v32)  See also Mark 3v39.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Holy Spirit is holy and a distinct person.  He was upon the
            Lord Jesus, but the Lord still points out that there is a
            distinct glory and majesty attached to the Holy Spirit which
            would make a word spoken against Him a serious charge indeed.
            Meanwhile the Lord Himself says that a word spoken 
            against the Son of man would be forgiven.
          </p>

          <p class="scripture">
            “And as they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy
            Spirit said, Separate me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to
            which I have called them.”  (Acts 13v2).
          </p>
          
          <p class="scripture">
            “They therefore, having been sent forth by the Holy Spirit, went
            down to Seleucia, and thence sailed away to Cyprus.”  (Acts
            13v4).
          </p>

          <p class="scripture">
            “For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay upon
            you no greater burden than these necessary things:”  (Acts
            15v28).
          </p>

          <p class="scripture">
            “And having passed through Phrygia and the Galatian country,
            having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in
            Asia,”  (Acts 16v6). 
          </p>

          <p class="scripture">
            “And I heard a voice out of the heaven saying, Write, Blessed the
            dead who die in [the] Lord from henceforth. Yea, saith the
            Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; for their works
            follow with them.” (Revelation 14v13)
          </p>

          <p class="scripture">
            “Wherefore, even as says the Holy Spirit, To-day if ye will hear
            his voice (Hebrews 3v7)
          </p>

          <p>
            This scripture shows that the Holy Spirit speaks.
          </p>

          <p class="scripture">
            “And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with which ye have
            been sealed for [the] day of redemption.” (Ephesians 4v30).
          </p>

          <p>
            The Holy Spirit can be grieved, this is a personal feeling.
          </p>

          <p class="scripture">
            “And in like manner the Spirit joins also its help to our
            weakness; for we do not know what we 	should pray for as is
            fitting, but the Spirit itself makes intercession with groanings
            which cannot be uttered. But he who searches the hearts knows
            what [is] the mind of the Spirit, because he intercedes for
            saints according to God.”  (Romans 8v26-27)
          </p>

          <p>
            The Holy Spirit intercedes for us on our behalf as also does the
            Lord (see Romans 8v34 and Hebrews 7v25).
          </p>

          <p class="scripture">
            "Having come down to Mysia, they attempted to go to Bithynia, and
            the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them;" (Acts 16v7:).
          </p>

          <p class="scripture">
            “Now the Lord is the Spirit, but where the Spirit of [the] Lord
            [is, there is] liberty. But we all, looking on the glory of the
            Lord, with unveiled face, are transformed according to the same
            image from glory to glory, even as by [the] Lord [the] Spirit.”
            (2 Corinthians 3v17-18).
          </p>

          <p>
            The Holy Spirit of God is the Lord’s Spirit.  He gives us liberty
            and He is the power of our transformation to glory.  The Spirit
            shows us the glories of the Lord.
          </p>

          <p>
            See also Revelation 2 and 3:  The Lord speaks but it says
            regularly to <em>“He that has an ear, let him hear what the
            Spirit says to the assemblies.”</em>
          </p>

          <p>
            The Holy Spirit is one with the Father and the Son.  These
            scriptures show that He has a voice, speaks, has divine feelings,
            has creatorial power and took an active part in empowering both
            the Lord’s ministry and the ministry of the apostles.  These
            scriptures show the Holy Spirit is more than some sort of force,
            power or feeling.  He is a divine person, distinct and yet one
            with the Father and the Son.  The Holy Spirit is God and God has
            revealed Himself as the Holy Spirit to empower the saints
            individually and the Church as a whole.

            “If therefore ye, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your
            children, how much rather shall the Father who is of heaven give

          </p>

          <p>
            The Holy Spirit has been sent by the Father and the Son.  The
            Lord has ascended into heaven to sit as a man at the right hand
            of God (Colossians 3v1).  He has sent the Holy Spirit to be a
            Comforter to us in His absence.  The Father has sent the Spirit
            at the request of the Son.  It is the Lord who asked the Father
            on our behalf that we might have the Spirit.

          </p>

          <p>
              When we read the scriptures, written by holy men, we should
              always remember that it was the Holy Spirit who inspired and
              indighted them (i.e. put them into words).  Prophets wrote down
              the word of God as directed by the Spirit of God.

            the magnitude of the grace shown to us (but also that grace in
            Himself); he was promised to us but also makes the promises of
            God more certain to us; we have been sealed with Him so He is
            also God’s seal on us as his work; He is the means by which we
            have access into the presence of the Father (Ephesians 2v18); He
            is Holy in His person marking out the perfection of the Son of
            God, but also ourselves (1 Peter 1v15).  He is the earnest of our
            inheritance, marking out the seriousness and reality of God’s
            promises to us.  He is God and therefore eternal, without
            beginning or end.  He is our blessed Comforter in the absence of
            the Lord and thus we can speak with Him as the disciples would
            speak to the Lord.  It is by Him and through Him we are led into
            the appreciation of divine things and persons.  He is the Spirit
            of our adoption enabling us to enter the relationship of son with
            the Father and appreciate it in all its blessedness.
