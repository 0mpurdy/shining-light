        <h1>The Holy Spirit: Dwelling in us</h1>

            <p>
              The Holy Spirit is not only with us as Christians but we are also
              told that He dwells in every Christian.  However, there is a
              distinction between being indwelt by the Holy Spirit and what the
              Bible calls being “filled with the Holy Spirit”.
            </p>

            <p>
              This study looks at the Holy Spirit’s indwelling and filling of a
              Christian and the effect this has on their life.  It also looks
              at when we receive the Holy Spirit.

              which is in you, which ye have of God; and ye are not your own?”
              (1 Corinthians 6v19).

              not of him” (Romans 8v9). 
            </p>

            <p class="scripture">
                “I give you therefore to know, that no one, speaking in the

                can say, Lord Jesus, unless in the power of the Holy Spirit.”

            <p class="scripture">
              “In whom ye also [have trusted], having heard the word of the
              truth, the glad tidings of your salvation; in whom also, having
              believed, ye have been sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise”
              (Ephesians 1v13).  </p>

            <p class="scripture">
              “And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with which ye have
              been sealed for [the] day of redemption.” (Ephesians 4v30).
            </p>

            <p class="scripture">
              “The Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit, that we are
              children of God.” (Romans 8v16).
            </p>

            <p>
              The Holy Spirit is dwelling within the believer.  He has taken up
              residence within us at the request of the Son and by the will of
              the Father.  He empowers the members of the Church in a special
              way that was not available to those in previous dispensations.
              It is by the Spirit that we are first able to say at our
              conversion and beyond, “Lord Jesus”.  Our bodies have become
              temples of the Holy Spirit where he is now dwelling.  Indeed, the
              scripture says that we are now 'in Spirit' because anyone who has
              not the Holy Spirit is not Christ’s and therefore is not saved!
              So if we have accepted the Lord Jesus as our saviour and have
              asked Him to save us, we have been sealed with the Holy Spirit.
              May we come to appreciate this more and more!  So the Spirit now
              declares that we are children of God, having been born again by
              His work and will. Also we have been sealed as His, much like a
              parcel is sealed with an address indicating its destination, thus
              we also have been sealed by the Spirit to be carried with Him to
              our heavenly destination at that day of final redemption when the
              Lord comes for us.

            <p>
              In the Old Testament and before Christ in the New Testament there
              are definite examples of people being filled with the Holy
              Spirit. See Exodus 31v3 (Bezaleel, son of Uri), Micah 3v8
              (Micah), Luke 1v15 (John the Baptist), Luke 1v41 (Elizabeth),

              gave to them to speak forth.” (Acts 2v3-4).

            </p>

            <p>
              There are definite examples of people being ‘filled with the Holy
              Spirit’ throughout the scriptures.  In the Old Testament it
              happened to persons who were marked out for special service by
              God and the Holy Spirit came upon them to empower them for that
              service.  It was not the lot of every Israelite and certainly
              didn’t mark someone all the time as it was connected to
              maintaining a pure state (see the Nazarite, also the life of
              Samson and 1 Samuel 16v14).  The Holy Spirit has indwelt only the
              Church which began at Pentecost so there is something special
              about being filled with the Holy Spirit.
            </p>

            <p>
              The scriptures above make clear that being filled with the Spirit
              is something that should mark a Christian constantly.  The Holy
              Spirit seems to have particularly been noticed during moments of
              great testimony or witness (see “The Holy Spirit: His service”).
              The disciples were directed, given boldness, given joy and able
              to work miracles by the Spirit. The Christian is indwelt by the
              Holy Spirit but there are times when we particularly feel His
              power and help, especially when we are 'walking in the Spirit'
              and allowing ourselves to be 'led by the Spirit'.  If we
              disregard the Holy Spirit's working in us or give greater place
              in our lives to fulfilling the flesh's lusts we cannot expect to
              be walking in the full power of the Spirit.  He will not abandon
              us for He is the Comforter in the absence of the Lord, neither
              can anything we do remove the cleansing power of the Lord's
              blood, therefore the Holy Spirit will never leave us but His
              witness in our lives may be quenched (1 Thessalonians 5v19).  It
              should be our daily exercise to make sure that the Holy Spirit is
              having His rightful place in our lives so that we can, not only
              be indwelt by Him, but that, with everything of ourselves gone,
              we can be filled with His presence.  It is then that we can
              experience the joy in times of trial, boldness in the gospel and
              power to overcome the flesh (for the Spirit is against the flesh:
              Galatians 5v17).  God has given us His Holy Spirit but we now
              must ask Him for strength to appreciate that gift and to be
              constantly conscious of His presence.

            <h2>What characterises someone who is filled by the Holy Spirit?</h2>

            <p class="scripture">
              “But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering,
              kindness, goodness, fidelity, meekness, self-control: against
              such things there is no law.  But they that are] of the Christ
              have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts. If we
              live by the Spirit, let us walk also by the Spirit.” (Galatians
              5v22-25).
            </p>
            
            <p>
              There are characteristics which are not found in the natural man
              which give evidence of the Holy Spirit's presence.  The presence
              of the Spirit does not bring chaos or loudness but rather peace
              and joy.  The Christian will be loving, peaceful, meek, not given
              to a temper, shouting or sudden changes of mood, but marked by a
              meek, quiet and loyal spirit with self-control.
            </p>

            <p>
              There are some fundamental differences between the character of
              the Holy Spirit in the believer and the character of the sinner
              influenced by Satan.  The believer is indwelt and influenced by
              the Holy Spirit; the unsaved sinner is influenced by Satan.
              Satan also has spirits which take possession of men.  It would be
              valuable for a believer to test every spirit by comparing their
              different effects seen in the scriptures.
            </p>

            <p>
              Men were sometimes brought to the Lord possessed by other
              spirits.  For examples see Luke 7v21, Luke 9v42,Acts 8v7, Acts
              19v14-16, Luke 8v2, 1 Samuel 28 and Acts 16v16.  There are some
              characteristics marking out wicked spirits.  First, once they are
              allowed to take possession of a person they take complete control
              and the person is no longer able to control themselves (see Mark
              5 and Luke 8).  Secondly the spirits can often speak through the
              people they are possessing.  Thirdly, they aim to completely
              humiliate and degrade their victim making them act in an unseemly
              way, often naked.  Fourthly, they give their victim great
              physical power such as great strength or enable them to do magic
              arts, capable of great acts (see Exodus 7v11).  Finally, they may
              make much of the person under their influence bringing admiration
              or fear upon others around them.  All this is intended to make
              much of the person and ultimately keep them from God.  Every
              example given in scripture was healed by the Lord Jesus.  People
              with the spirit of python were released and people possessed by
              demons were healed; the disciples even being given power over
              them by the Lord (Matthew 10v1, Mark 6v7, Luke 9v1).
            </p>

            <p>
              In contrast the characteristics of someone filled by the Holy
              Spirit are very different. The Holy Spirit indwells the believer
              claiming them for God, but He does not remove their
              responsibility to act in accordance with His presence, in other
              words a believer is not possessed unable to control themselves
              but can now have self-control over the will of the flesh and its
              lusts.  The Holy Spirit empowers people to speak and gives the
              words to say but He does not take over their lips and voice,
              speaking for them.  The Holy Spirit also wants to glorify the new
              creation in a Christian in the presence of God helping them to
              appreciate the place of sonship.  Therefore the joy and blessing
              of His presence does not go along with stupidity, buffoonery, low
              resistance to lusts and lack of control (see Ephesians 5v1-6) but
              rather a meek and quiet spirit of service to God.  The Holy
              Spirit is the power of the believer and will act in a way which
              is in accordance with His will for the glory of God, for He will
              never make much of the Christian but rather the God of the
              Christian.  Thus finally, the work of the Holy Spirit will bring
              people to God with the serving Christian disappearing out of
              sight.
            </p>

            <p>
              The disciples, for example, at Pentecost were marked by boldness
              and had self-control.  Thus Peter was able to easily dismiss the
              claims that they were drunk; standing up and preaching the
              gospel.  They were not marked by changing emotions or feelings
              but joy, peace and boldness in the gospel.
            </p>

            <p>
              Let us keep these distinctions in mind to help us "prove the
              spirits" (1 John 4v1).  A spirit of Satan will make much of men
              to keep them from God, but the Holy Spirit will always make much
              of God and nothing of man.  The Christian, marked by the Spirit,
              will have new life, joy and peace, not being marked by the things
              of the flesh also seen in Galatians 5.
