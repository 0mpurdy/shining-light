            <p>
                Worship is mentioned a lot in scripture.  It is something that we are expected to do as Christians, but there are many events around us that 
                are branded as worship and there is a general misunderstanding about what worship of God actually is.  This paper continues the study on 
                worship by looking at what worship is and how it affects us.

            <h2>Worship is our ultimate purpose</h2>
          
            <p>
              Worship appears throughout the scriptures.  There is the worship of idols and there is the worship of God.  A person can worship something other 
              than God.  His or her whole life and thoughts can be absorbed and consumed with slavish subservience to something else, whether it be an idol or 
              a deity of our own making, such as our work, family or wealth. 
            </p>

            <p>
                However, the purpose of our lives is to worship God to the exclusion of all else.  Alas, even as Christians we are sometimes brought to 
                realise that we are worshipping something else in our lives which is impairing the full flow of worship to God and needs to be pulled down 
                from the pedestal that we have always given it.  All our idols have to go: reputation, desires, plans, patriotism, etc, so that God might 
                occupy the whole of our being. <b>“For ye have been bought with a price: glorify now then God in your body” (1 Corinthians 6:20).</b> Some of the 
                key features of worship in the Bible are given below:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                  Worship is personal:<br>
                  <b>“And Job rose up, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down on the ground, and worshipped, and he said, Naked came I out of 
                    my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: Jehovah gave, and Jehovah hath taken away; blessed be the name of Jehovah!” (Job 1:20-
                    21). “And he said, Swear to me; and he swore to him. And Israel worshipped on the bed's head” (Genesis 47:31).</b>  <em>For more see ‘worship 
                    is continual’.</em>
              </li>
              <li>
                  Worship can be collective:<br>
                  <b>“And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded, all the time until the burnt-offering was 
                    finished. And when they had ended offering the burnt-offering, the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves and 
                    worshipped. And king Hezekiah and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praise to Jehovah with the words of David, and of Asaph the 
                    seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and bowed their heads and worshipped” (2 Chronicles 29:28-30).  “And Ezra blessed Jehovah, the 
                    great God; and all the people answered, Amen, Amen! with lifting up of their hands; and they bowed their heads, and worshipped Jehovah 
                    with their faces to the ground” (Nehemiah 8:6).</b>
              </li>
              <li>
                  Worship is continual:<br>
                  <b>“And also I have lent him to Jehovah: all the days that he lives, he is lent to Jehovah. And he worshipped Jehovah there” (1 Samuel 
                    1:28).  “And a certain woman, by name Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, who worshipped God, heard; whose heart the Lord 
                    opened to attend to the things spoken by Paul” (Acts 16:14).</b>  Lydia was a woman characterised by worship.  <b>“And departing thence he 
                    came to the house of a certain man, by name Justus, who worshipped God, whose house adjoined the synagogue” (Acts 18:7).</b>
              </li>
              <li>
                  Worship is in spirit and truth:<br>
                  <b>“God is a spirit; and they who worship him must worship him in spirit and truth” (John 4:24).</b>
              </li>
              <li>
                  Worship is in the presence of God:<br>
                  <b>“This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Jehovah. And when I saw, I fell on my face, and I heard a voice of one that 
                  spoke” (Ezekiel 1:28).</b>
              </li>
              <li>                
                  Worship is of the Holy Spirit:<br>
                  <b>“For we are the circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of God, and boast in Christ Jesus, and do not trust in flesh” (Philippians 3:3).</b>
              </li>
              <li>
                  Worship is the purpose of God’s work in us:<br>
                  <b>“being complete as regards the fruit of righteousness, which is by Jesus Christ, to God's glory and praise” (Philippians 1:11).</b>
              </li>
              <li>
                  Worship is a result of joy and wonder:<br>
                  <b>“Give unto Jehovah the glory of his name; worship Jehovah in holy splendour” (Psalm 29:2).</b>
              </li>
              <li>
                  Worship is as a result of understanding more of God’s person:<br>
                  <b>“Thou art the Same, thou alone, Jehovah, who hast made the heaven of heavens, and all their host, the earth and all that is therein, 
                    the seas and all that is therein. And thou quickenest them all; and the host of heaven worshippeth thee” (Nehemiah 9:6).  “Exalt Jehovah 
                    our God, and worship at his footstool. He is holy!” (Psalm 99:5).  “Come, let us worship and bow down; let us kneel before Jehovah our 
                    Maker” (Psalm 95:6).</b>
              </li>
                  
            
            </ul>

            <p>
                So our worship is really our complete reverence and adoration of God’ Person.  He is holy, he is inscrutable, He is pure, He is light and this 
                causes us to look at Him in awe.  Yet He is love, He is compassionate and He is able to do all things to and for us.  We worship God because 
                He is the Almighty God and yet we worship Him for the sheer magnitude of His unbounded love.  We worship Him because we are brought into a sense 
                of His awesome power, character, purity, holiness and the greatness of His love and what it has accomplished for us in Christ.
            </p>
            
                   
          </div>


          <div class="section">
              <h2>The continuous nature of our worship</h2>
              <p>
                  Worship can be a deliberate action where we set aside a particular time or place to worship God as Elkanah did <b>“And this man went up 
                  out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice to Jehovah of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, 
                  the priests of Jehovah, were there” (1 Samuel 1:3).</b>  Yet, worship is a continual state of mind and heart in a Christian.  A Christian does 
                  not have a secular life and a spiritual life.  They are, in fact, one and the same thing.  <b>“And everything, whatever ye may do in word or in 
                  deed, do all things in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father by him” (Colossians 3:17).</b>  Everything that we do is 
                  done for the Lord.  Why?  We are worshipping Him.  We are so consumed with the knowledge of His Presence and the glory of His Person that 
                  our whole life is done for Him and for His pleasure.  We go to work, school, the shops, our leisure time, etc. and are filled with God.  We 
                  have our eyes so fixed on Him that it colours all our everyday activities and words.  Our lives reflect Him at every moment and our free 
                  time is spent rejoicing in His presence with us for He is in every part of His universe.  Our activities therefore will be reflective of 
                  the extent to which we are daily absorbed with God.  The Lord says that <b>“By their fruits then surely ye shall know them” (Matthew 7:20).</b>
              </p>

          
            <p>
                In Isaiah 6, Ezekiel 1 and the book of Revelation we find the heavenly creatures worshipping God.  The twenty-four elders gladly fall down 
                before God in worship and cast their crowns at His feet.  This worship is characterised by joyful wonder at the Person of God.  It will be 
                our lot in eternity.  We will be filled with such immense joy and wonder in the Presence of the God whom we have only begun to know that we 
                will worship Him for all eternity.
            </p>
           
            <p>
                One final point to make is that worship is from our spirit.  It doesn’t involve words or songs (more on this later), but is the movement of 
                the heart.  In most cases where it is mentioned in the Bible it is where someone falls on their face and worships.  No words are mentioned, 
                no hymns are sung only a heart overwhelmed with the Presence of God bowed before Him.
            </p>

           
          </div>

          <div class="section">
              <h2>The attitude of worship</h2>
              
              
              <p>
                  If God is in His rightful place in our lives, then worship will be the all-consuming purpose of our life.  The Lord may allow us to pass 
                  through trials to test His work in us and to bring us into a greater knowledge of Himself and in so doing we will be filled with a greater 
                  awe at the working out of His will in us according to His ways which ore higher than ours.  For example, after losing his family it says of 
                  Job: <b>“And Job rose up, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down on the ground, and worshipped, and he said, Naked came I out 
                  of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: Jehovah gave, and Jehovah hath taken away; blessed be the name of Jehovah!” 
                  (Job 1:20-21).</b>  What a spirit of worship!  Nothing was going to shake his obsession with God.  In the end He came to a greater knowledge of 
                  God than he had ever known before and was given greater blessings than he had before his time of trial began.

              </p>

            <p>
                Likewise, Abraham: <b>“And Abraham said to his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come 
                  again to you” (Genesis 22:5).</b>  Abraham was asked to sacrifice his son, the one in whom God had said that a great nation would be born.  
                  What agony of soul Abraham had to pass through we can only begin to imagine as he reached the point that he would yield his son to the 
                  will of God.  He too received greater blessing as a result of this trial.

            </p>

            <p>
                God said to the children of Israel: <b>“For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith Jehovah, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, 
                  to give you in your latter end a hope. And ye shall call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you; and ye 
                  shall seek me and find me, for ye shall search for me with all your heart, and I will be found of you, saith Jehovah. And I will turn your 
                  captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations, and from all the places whither I have driven you, saith Jehovah; and I will 
                  bring you again into the place whence I have caused you to be carried away captive” (Jeremiah 29:11-14).</b>  He didn’t say that they wouldn’t 
                  go into captivity, for they had sinned and deserved to be removed from the land of God’s blessing, but that they would learn Him in their 
                  time of trial and return more focussed on Him than they were before when they were consumed with idolatry.

            </p>

            <p>
                So we are told that <b>“we do know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to 
                  purpose” (Romans 8:28).</b>  He will form us to be worshippers.  The attitude of worshippers is that we are focussed on God Himself and we 
                  will bow to all that He has to do to us to make us know Him better.  This will cause our worship of Him to grow and give Him greater 
                  delight.  Thus as a worshipper, we will be ready for whatever service He gives to us.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>"Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, pipe, lute, sambuca, psaltery, and bagpipe, 
                  and all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image; and that whosoever doth not fall down and worship, shall be cast 
                  into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. There are certain Jews whom thou hast appointed over the administration of the province of 
                  Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego: these men, O king, regard thee not; they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image 
                  that thou hast set up. … But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image that 
                  thou hast set up.” (Daniel 3:10-12 & 18).</b>
            </p>

            <p>
                When we have begun to worship God, then nothing will shake us from it.  All the opposition of the most powerful king on earth at the time 
                could make these three men worship something else.  Even if God did not save them from the fiery furnace they would not worship an idol.  
                They would rather suffer knowing that they would be with God after death than try to escape the flames.  This is because a worshipper of God 
                cares little for this life knowing that a better one awaits.  They have tasted the eternal life and long to be nearer the One they now know.  
                Paul was like this as he suffered through life yet he could speak of the “good deposit” that he had committed into the Lord’s hands.  He was 
                focussed on the <b>“appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ”</b>.  He longed to see the one that he worshipped.

            </p>

            <p>
                The attitude of a worshipper of God is that we will rejoice in anything that brings us closer to God.  It may be a time of testing, it may be 
                that we see His goodness in blessing us and it may be a time discipline where we learn His love and care for us (see Revelation 3:19).  
                Regardless, a worshipper is unshakable and will give up anything that might take God’s place in our hearts.  They might not feel in a 
                worshipful spirit all the time as daily life goes on, but their whole attitude of life will be bent towards giving God glory in everything 
                and staying in His presence through every moment.

            </p>

          <div class="section">
              <h2>The purpose of Man</h2>
              
              <p class="scripture">
                  “But the hour is coming and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth; for also the Father seeks 
                  such as his worshippers” (John 4:23).
              </p>

              
              <p>
                  Here we find the secret of man’s true purpose on earth.  God is seeking worshippers who worship in spirit and in truth.  God delights in 
                  worshippers.  A picture of this is in Psalm 45 where it says of the king (the Lord Jesus), <b>“And the king will desire thy beauty; for he is 
                  thy Lord, and worship thou him” (Psalm 45:11).</b>  The Lord came to earth to secure His bride, the Church/Assembly.  He has absolute 
                  delight in her and she worships Him.  A bride going to her wedding is so filled with love for her groom that it might be said that ‘she 
                  worships him’.  That is the sense of our worship for the Lord, our bridegroom to whom we will one day soon be united.
              </p>

              
              <p>
                  God has revealed Himself in such a wonderful way, as Father, Son and Holy Spirit, demonstrating His love so amazingly at the cross as He 
                  Himself bore the punishment He had pronounced for our sins.  In so doing He has not gained a number of robots who are programmed to worship 
                  but He has won the hearts and affections of those who love Him.  <b>“How much rather shall the blood of the Christ, who by the eternal Spirit 
                  offered himself spotless to God, purify your conscience from dead works to worship the living God?” (Hebrews 9:14).</b>  As we see what He has 
                  personally done for us and glimpse the character of His glorious and loving person we rejoice in being near to Him and in enjoying the 
                  relationship He has brought us into with Himself.
