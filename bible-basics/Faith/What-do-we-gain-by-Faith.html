              Faith has been the means of wonderful blessing to us from God.  It is the doorway to all that God has for us to enjoy.  It is also the means 
              by which we gain all that we need for service.  This study looks briefly at what a Christian has gained as a result of faith.

            <h2>What do we gain from faith?</h2>
            <p>
              Without having to earn our salvation we have been saved.  Our salvation is purely based on God’s mercy and grace towards us in that He gave His 
              Son to save us and then led us to repentance so that we might be saved through faith in Him.  There are many things we have gained as a result of 
              this faith in our Lord Jesus.

                      Power to overcome:

                      <p class="scripture">
                      “But the Lord said, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye had said to this sycamine tree, Be thou rooted up, 
                      and be thou planted in the sea, and it would have obeyed you” (Luke 17:6).  
                    </p>

                      <p>
                        Faith can remove many an obstacle in our lives and when we trust in God to help us great problems can become very small.

              to those who hope in the Lord; from those who had nothing to those who are indwelt by the Holy Spirit and have access to God’s blessing.  Through faith, God has 
              transformed us and glorified us placing us where we could never have been but for His grace through faith in Christ Jesus.
