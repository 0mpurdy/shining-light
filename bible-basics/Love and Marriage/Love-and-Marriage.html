        <h1>Love and Marriage</h1>
        <div class="wrapped centered">

            <p>
                Perhaps one of the greatest practical decisions we will ever have to make is about choosing the right person to marry.  In the Bible, 
                marriage is the only basis in scripture for a man and a woman to become one and live together.  It is a holy commitment before God 
                that is intended to last for life.  This paper looks at how a Christian is to approach both love and marriage.

                The statements were originally presented as a power point presentation and were discussed by those present.  There is further discussion 
                on some aspects at the end.

              <h2>Love at first sight occurs between some people</h2>
              <p>
                  False. Thinking this statement is true is based on a misunderstanding of love.  The world view of love = lust, a self centred desire for 
                  pleasure. God's definition of love is a selfless, sacrificial, and unconditional love.
              </p>
              <p>
                  To develop a relationship of love with another person requires that you really get to know them first.  Physical attraction can be “at 
                  first sight” but is this love?
              </p>

        <div class="article">
              <div class="section">
                  <h2>It is easy to distinguish real love from infatuation</h2>
                  <p>
                      False – it is often difficult to tell apart especially in the early stages.
                      Real love edifies. Two people in love seek the best for the other person (see 1 Corinthians 13v4-8). 
                      Infatuation is selfish and driven by the desire to have your own needs met.
                  </p>

          <div class="article">
                <div class="section">
                    <h2>If a man and woman genuinely love each other it makes little or no difference if one of them does not believe in the Lord.</h2>
                    <p>
                        False.  In 2 Corinthians 6:14 it says <b>“Be not diversely yoked with unbelievers; for what participation is there between righteousness and lawlessness? or what fellowship of light with darkness?”</b> 
                        Therefore a Christian should never date a non-Christian.  Dating someone with hopes you will win them to Christ is an unwise practice for Christians as they may end up attached to them for life which could be a great 
                        hindrance to spiritual growth. Marriage in the Lord is vital (see also 1 Corinthians 7v39).

                      <h2>God selects one particular person for each of us to marry and He will guide us together.</h2>
                      <p>
                          There is a false security in this.  Relying on this as a method of selection could result in you 
                          deciding for the first eligible person who enters your life! There is no spiritual exercise before God in this approach.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                          However, God will provide confirmation as you pray about these things in the Spirit. (see Isaac & Rebecca & the servant in Genesis 24).

                      <p>
                          False.  God sometimes calls people to remain single in their work for Him.  In 1 Corinthians 7 Paul goes over the pros and cons of being single or married.  There is blessing for both.

                          False. <b>“But fornication and all uncleanness or unbridled lust, let it not be even named among you” (Ephesians 5v3).</b> 
                          Righteousness should be the hallmark of Christian dating relationships.

                      <p>
                          Hopefully this will be true, but it is not automatic.  A marriage relationship is a living bond and just like the 
                          example of Christ and the assembly it needs to be nourished and cherished (see Ephesians 5v29).
                      </p>
                      <p>
                          God provides us with all we need to maintain a lifelong loving relationship but it needs each to be filled with the Spirit, 
                          filled with His love and submitting to one another with thankful hearts (see Ephesians 5 v 18-21).

                          False. <b>“And walk in love, as Christ also has loved us and given Himself for us” (Ephesians 5v2).</b> Christian love is something that grows with 
                          time and with our appreciation of God’s love towards us. This has the effect of strengthening our natural relationships too. Christian love is 
                          based on our appreciation of the love of Christ for us.  The 
                          more we understand of the greatness of the Lord’s love for us, the more we will be able to demonstrate love to our spouse.

                Obviously the subject of love is a huge subject and is covered in numerous places in the Word of God, but I'm going to try to summarize things and find a starting point here:
                <b>“Be ye therefore imitators of God, as beloved children, and walk in love, even as the Christ loved us, and delivered himself up for us, an offering and sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour.” (Ephesians 5v1-2).</b>
