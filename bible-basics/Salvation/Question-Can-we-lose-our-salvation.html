        <h1>Question: Can we lose our Salvation</h1>
        <div class="wrapped centered">
          <div>
            <p class="scripture">
                Recently I met a man who told me that we only had our sins forgiven up to the day I was saved and that if I sinned again I 
                could cease to be saved and again be lost.  Is this true?
            </p>

            <p>
                This is a fundamental question for every Christian.  The answer to this will determine whether we live in fear or peace and whether we are 
                able to enjoy our salvation or tremble at the thought of losing it.  I hope this answer, though quite long, will give you the assurance of 
                knowing that salvation is permanent.

            <h2>Faith alone or good works?</h2>
            
            <p>
              I once met someone who believed that preaching that salvation is permanent meant that we were giving people false hope and telling people that 
              they could continue to sin after being originally saved.  However, to take this view, fundamentally destroys the very purpose for which we are 
              saved, i.e. to be given liberty, joy, peace and to be without fear so that we can worship God in freedom of heart, enraptured with the one who 
              loves us so much.  We cannot be persons who are worshipping God if we are still focussed on our own failings and weaknesses.  Likewise, we cannot 
              be worshipping Christians if we are going back to our sins and old fleshly pleasures.  This view of being saved today and then going back to sin 
              actually indicates that the new creation in Christian has not been fully understood.  A Christian doesn’t want to go back to sin because they have 
              found such tremendous peace, joy and liberty in our Lord Jesus, by the power and indwelling of the Holy Spirit and in relationship with the 
              Almighty God as our Father.  Our hearts have been changed to find joy in God’s divine will and finds little pleasure in the temporary 
              entertainments and lusts of this world.  (Read the studies on ‘Salvation’ as well as ‘Faith’ and ‘Justification’.)
            </p>

            <p>
                Let’s look closely at some of the scriptures relating to this:
            </p>
          </div>

        <div class="article">

            <h2>God’s purpose involves salvation: He is satisfied with Jesus’ life and person</h2>

            <p>
              God’s purpose is that we should be saved.  This was the purpose of God in sending the Lord Jesus who came to do God’s will.  God’s will, 
              we are told, is that he <b>“desires that all men should be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth” (1 Timothy 2:4).</b>  God has been so 
              satisfied in the perfection and person of His Son that He has made Him the basis for our salvation.  He declared on two occasions that the 
              Lord Jesus was His beloved Son. The first time He declared His delight in the Lord’s life and in the second time He said “hear him” placing 
              His seal of approval thereby on the Lord’s teaching and ministry.  We find in several scriptures that it is the Lord’s life and His faith that 
              is the power that gives us life, for if the Lord had not been perfection itself then He could not have been a sacrifice for our sins. 
              Hebrews 7:27 says of the Lord Jesus that he <b>“has not day by day need, as the high priests, first to offer up sacrifices for his own sins, 
              then for those of the people; for this he did once for all in having offered up himself”.</b>  He offered up Himself for He had no sin.  He has 
              no need to offer up any more.  We are told that as our great high priest He continues to intercede for us but there is no question of our 
              needing another sacrifice for dealing with sins.

            </p>
            <p class="scripture">
                “For if, being enemies, we have been reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much rather, having been reconciled, we shall be saved 
                in the power of his life” (Romans 5:10).
            </p>
            
            <p class="scripture">
                "For this is the will of my Father, that every one who sees the Son, and believes on him, should have life eternal; and I will raise him up 
                at the last day” (John 6:40).
            </p>

            <p class="scripture">
                “He that believes on the Son has life eternal, and he that is not subject to the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides 
                upon him” (John 3:36).
            </p>

            <p class="scripture">
                “And this is the witness, that God has given to us eternal life; and this life is in his Son. He that has the Son has life: he that has not 
                the Son of God has not life.  These things have I written to you that ye may know that ye have eternal life who believe on the name of the 
                Son of God.” (1 John 5:11-13).
            </p>
            
            <p>
                God was infinitely satisfied with the Lord Jesus and therefore the Lord Jesus is the fundamental basis of salvation.  We have either believed 
                on God’s Son and have salvation; or we have rejected God’s beloved Son and have no salvation.
            </p>

            <p class="scripture">
                “But when the kindness and love to man of our Saviour God appeared, not on the principle of works which have been done in righteousness which 
                we had done, but according to his own mercy he saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit, which he poured 
                out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Saviour; that, having been justified by his grace, we should become heirs according to the hope of 
                eternal life” (Titus 3:4-7).
            </p>

            <p>
                This quotation from Titus shows clearly that it is not we who have cleansed ourselves but God who has washed us according to His own mercy 
                and by His own power.  His aim is that we should become heirs according to eternal life.  We have not influenced God’s decision but it was 
                according to His own mercy that we have been saved.
            </p>

            <p class="scripture">
                “He came to his own, and his own received him not; but as many as received him, to them gave he the right to be children of God, to those 
                that believe on his name; who have been born, not of blood, nor of flesh's will, nor of man's will, but of God” (John 1:11-13).
            </p>

            <p>
                Once we have been saved then we have been made children of God by receiving the Lord Jesus.  We have been born again according to God’s will.  
                We cannot be unborn or lose the new creation that is referred to in 1 Corinthians 5:17 and Galatians 6:15. God has started something new in 
                us and while we still have our sinful bodies (what the Bible calls “the flesh”) that body has been crucified with Christ and can’t be 
                uncrucified.
            </p>

            <p>
                So, our salvation is founded on God’s delight in His Son and the Lord’s life was a complete delight to Him.

            <h2>The Lord Jesus’ sacrifice is the reason why we are saved.</h2>

            <p>
                <b>“For ye are saved by grace, through faith; and this not of yourselves; it is God's gift: not on the principle of works, that no one might 
                  boast” (Ephesians 2:8-9).</b>  This scripture makes it abundantly clear that we are not saved by our own efforts.  Even if we could live a life 
                  that was outwardly holy we would fail because our thoughts are governed by sinful emotions such as lust and pride.  If the Lord’s death on 
                  the cross only partially removed our sins up to a certain date we would still have to live in fear because of our daily failings.  God desires 
                  to show mercy to all (Romans 11:32) and so He has given the Lord Jesus.  All the offerings given in the book of Leviticus speak of the sacrifice 
                  being unblemished and give us an image of the perfection of the ultimate sacrifice.  Peter tells us that we have been redeemed <b>“by precious 
                  blood, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot, the blood of Christ” (1 Peter 1:19)</b>.  His blood was valuable to God because it 
                  represented a perfect life given up in love for sinners (see Leviticus 17:14 and Deuteronomy 12:23).  God’s will was all that mattered to the 
                  Lord Jesus and it was by that will that <b>“we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all” (Hebrews 10:10).</b>
            </p>

            <p>
                The blood of Jesus was shed according to the will of God.  That blood was infinitely precious to God because it represented a perfect life which was 
                surrendered in death out of love for God.  God has saved us because of the value of that blood and not because of anything we have done.  The scripture 
                is clear that we are worth nothing in our sins.  However, God has valued us even though we are naturally ungodly and saved us by virtue of the blood of 
                the Lord Jesus.

              <h2>The basis of our salvation</h2>
  
              <p>
                  Nothing can change the value of the Lord’s shed blood to God.

              <p>
                <b>“For ye are saved by grace, through faith; and this not of yourselves; it is God's gift: not on the principle of works, that no one might 
                  boast” (Ephesians 2:8-9).</b>  We can’t influence our own salvation, but God has given the faith needed to secure it.  He gave it, we did 
                  not earn it.  It is based on the value that God has for Jesus and the value God has on the blood that His Son so willingly shed to save us.

              </p>
              
              <p>
                  Not only that, but once we are saved we begin to realise that God had actually had us in mind for His blessing from before the world 
                  existed.  The fact that someone has repented and been saved is evidence of the fact that the Lord has worked in us to bring us to salvation.  
                  It is not we who decide to repent.  It is the <b>“goodness of God</b> [that] <b>leads thee to repentance?” (Romans 2:4)</b>.
              </p>
  
              <p class="scripture">
                  “Because whom he has foreknown, he has also predestinated to be conformed to the image of his Son, so that he should be the firstborn among 
                  many brethren” (Romans 8:29).
              </p>
  
              <p>
                  <b>“And all that dwell on the earth shall do it homage</b> [the image of the beast]<b>, every one whose name had not been written from the 
                    founding of the world in the book of life of the slain Lamb” (Romans 13:8).</b>  Every Christian has their name in the book of life.  This 
                    scripture shows that our names were written there before the world’s foundation.

              <p>
                  The thief on the cross beside the Lord Jesus was told <b>“This day, shalt thou be with me in paradise”.</b>  It was not conditional on his 
                  being pure in thought during the next few hours before he finally succumbed to death.  It was certain and secure.

            <div class="section">
              <h2>The purpose of our salvation was to free us to worship.</h2>
  
              <p>
                  Our salvation has a purpose.  It is to give us liberty (2 Corinthians 3:17), joy, peace (Romans 15:13), righteousness (2 Corinthians 5:21) 
                  and to bring us near to God (1 Peter 3:18).  We could enjoy none of these things if we had to continue to worry about whether our lives were 
                  good enough for God.  It is also to make us into worshippers in spirit and truth (John 4:23 and Hebrews 9:14).  We could not worship if we 
                  doubted the greatness of God’s love for <b>“perfect love casts out fear”.</b>

              </p>
  
              <p>
                  Hebrews tells us that God gave us strong encouragement which would give us hope that is to be a steadfast and sure anchor in our lives.  
                  <b>“In which it was impossible that God should lie, we might have a strong encouragement, who have fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope set 
                  before us, which we have as anchor of the soul, both secure and firm, and entering into that within the veil, where Jesus is entered as 
                  forerunner for us, become for ever a high priest according to the order of Melchisedec” (Hebrews 6:18-20)</b>.  We have been given access 
                  into God’s presence through the veil of separation between God and Man because of the Lord Jesus’ work on the cross.  The veil was torn 
                  from top to bottom when the Lord died. It would not be a secure nor firm anchor if that anchor could slip and our encouragement and 
                  salvation be lost.
              </p>

              <p>
                  We are also told that as a result of the Lord’s work we have been given God’s Holy Spirit to indwell us.  The Holy Spirit could not be in us 
                  if we had not been made holy.  We are unable to be holy in our own strength, but the Lord’s blood has cleansed us and we now are clothed in 
                  Christ’s righteousness.  The Holy Spirit within us is the evidence of our salvation (see Ephesians 1:14). Hence, Paul spent some time in 1 
                  Corinthians telling them that as their bodies were already temples of the Holy Spirit they should be aiming to live holy lives.  Their bodies 
                  had not ceased to be temples because of their failings but they were not representing truly the holy nature of the divine person who was 
                  indwelling them and indwells every Christian.
              </p>

              <p>
                  So, it would be impossible to fulfil the purpose of our salvation if we were still trying to make ourselves good enough for God.  God has 
                  given us the Holy Spirit so that we might rest assured in His love and in the certainty of His salvation.  We are then free to simply enjoy 
                  His presence and worship Him with free and joyful hearts.

                <p>
                    The Lord Jesus’ has made the ultimate sacrifice.  As our great high priest, He has offered up Himself and laid down His own perfect life 
                    to save us.  We are saved because God is satisfied completely in Jesus as our substitute.  To say that we could ever lose this salvation 
                    is to imply that God could ever value His Son and His sacrifice less.  Scripture is clear that the Lord Jesus died to remove our sins and 
                    make us free to serve and worship God in joy and peace.  The Lord Jesus has restored the link of fellowship between God and Mankind so 
                    that we might enjoy eternal life even now (see John 17:3).  We could not do this if we were required to keep the Law to gain salvation.  
                    This was the Law that the whole nation of Israel was unable to keep.
                </p>
  
                <p>
                    However, this does not give us license to live in sin.  Paul tackled this very suggestion in Romans chapter 6.  A Christian loves the 
                    Lord who saved them so much that their one driving desire is to serve Him and be for His will and pleasure.  Our old wants and desires 
                    are to be crucified with Christ so that we no longer live in sin.  <b>“Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with him, that the 
                    body of sin might be annulled, that we should no longer serve sin” (Romans 6:6)</b>.  Instead, we are told to <b>“have your mind on the things 
                    that are above, not on the things that are on the earth; for ye have died, and your life is hid with the Christ in God. When the Christ is 
                    manifested who is our life, then shall ye also be manifested with him in glory” (Colossians 3:2-4).</b>

                      So, our salvation cannot be undone because it is not based on us at all but solely on Christ and God’s valuation of His life and 
                      sacrifice.  May we live in the liberty that comes from being where the spirit of the Lord is and, while keeping ourselves unspotted 
                      from the world, be here for His glory and praise.  God has completed the whole work of salvation Himself on our behalf in the person 
                      of His Son.  Now His desire is that we should know Him as He knows us (see 1 Corinthians 13:12) and enjoy the rest into which He has 
                      brought us.  May our lives be filled with the spirit of worship, without fear, echoing words like these:
