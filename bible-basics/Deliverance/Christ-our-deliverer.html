              This study follows on from “The Old Man and the New Man”.  We
              know the Lord Jesus as our saviour and we know that He has
              delivered us from the wrath to come.  However, after we have
              tried to make ourselves suitable to God and failed we are able to
              rejoice in Him as the deliverer from our sinful lusts, desires
              and pride every day.  He delivers us so that we might have our
              focus on Him and Him alone, for there we shall find true joy.

          <h2>Christ our Deliverer</h2>

          <p>
            Our Lord Jesus is described as our deliverer from <em>“the coming
              wrath”</em>.  He has saved us from God’s judgement upon sinners and
            set us free in righteousness.  However, this study is to focus on one
            aspect of His being our deliverer -  his being our present deliverer.
          </p>

          <p>
            Paul describes the Lord as having delivered us from “so great a
            death” but then he tells us that he “does deliver” and that he will
            “yet deliver”.  From this scripture it is clear that the Lord id
            continually delivering us.
          </p>

          <p class="scripture">
            “But we ourselves had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we
            should not have our trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the
            dead; who has delivered us from so great a death, and does deliver;
            in whom we confide that he will also yet deliver” (2 Corinthians
            1:9-10).
          </p>

          <p>
            But what is He delivering us from at present?
          </p>
    
          <p class="scripture">
            “Grace to you, and peace, from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus
            Christ, who gave himself for our sins, so that he should deliver us
            out of the present evil world, according to the will of our God and
            Father; to whom be glory to the ages of ages. Amen” (Galatians
            1:3-5).
          </p>

          <p class="scripture">
            “The Lord shall deliver me from every wicked work, and shall
            preserve me for his heavenly kingdom; to whom be glory for the ages
            of ages. Amen” (2 Timothy 4:18).  </p>

          <p>
            The Lord is delivering us from the influence of the world (see
            paper on “The World in the Bible”) and from every wicked work.  The
            world’s influence appeals to what the Bible calls “the flesh” (i.e.
            our sinful nature that has been condemned by God).  The Lord is our
            deliverer from the world’s influence and the attacks of the ‘the
            world’.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>Deliverance from ‘the flesh’</h2>

            <p>
              However, there is another way in which the Lord Jesus acts as our
              deliverer.  He delivers us from the influence and desires of our
              ‘old man’, ‘the flesh’.
            </p>

            <p class="scripture">
                “For I delight in the law of God according to the inward man:
                but I see another law in my members, warring in opposition to
                the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law
                of sin which exists in my members. O wretched man that I am!
                who shall deliver me out of this body of death?  I thank God,
                through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then I myself with the mind
                serve God's law; but with the flesh sin's law. There is then
                now no condemnation to those in Christ Jesus. For the law of
                the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law
                of sin and of death.  For what the law could not do, in that it
                was weak through the flesh, God, having sent his own Son, in
                likeness of flesh of sin, and for sin, has condemned sin in the
                flesh, in order that the righteous requirement of the law
                should be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to flesh
                but according to Spirit” (Romans 7:22-8:4).
            </p>

            <p>
              Paul describes this experience where he finds a conflict going on
              inside himself.  The ‘new man’ under the power of the Holy Spirit
              desires to be pure, holy and God-honouring, yet he finds that
              ‘the flesh’ in his members (i.e. his body) there is a resistance
              to his desire and he finds that it is hindering his service for
              God.  He longs to be rid of this “body of death” and then he
              gives us the secret of overcoming the flesh -  Christ is the one
              who delivers us from ‘the flesh’.
            </p>

            <p>
              We can rejoice that the Lord Jesus has suffered our condemnation,
              not only for our sins when we were saved but has covered all our
              weaknesses and failings.  There is no condemnation left for us to
              face.  All our sin in the flesh has been condemned and we are
              free to walk in the spirit knowing that, in Christ, the righteous
              requirement of God’s Law has been fulfilled in us.  We can
              rejoice knowing that our failings will not be held against us.
            </p>

            <p>
              We may not feel joyful all the time.  Paul said that at one point
              he even despaired of living, but this did not alter his
              salvation.  When we fail we often find that we have blocked out
              God’s voice and so we experience a time when we pray like David
              “Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation, and let a willing
              spirit sustain me” (Psalm 51:12).  David had not lost his
              salvation, despite committing adultery with Bathsheba and
              organising Urijah’s death, but he became deeply conscious that he
              had lost the joy that comes with knowing we are saved.  God did
              not withdraw all his promises to David.  God’s promises stand
              regardless of the failures of His people.  He did seek David’s
              repentance, however, so that communion together might be restored
              and David might experience the joy of salvation again.  We also
              can quench the Holy Spirit, block out God’s voice, but God values
              the spark of affection for Him that brought us to Him in the
              first place and will always work to bring us back to Himself.
              Thus He could tell Balaam to say “He hath not beheld iniquity in
              Jacob, neither hath he seen wrong in Israel” (Numbers 23:21) and
              Hosea to prophesy “and she shall sing there, as in the days of
              her youth and as in the day when she came up out of the land of
              Egypt” (Hosea 2:15).  God valued the affections of Israel
              regardless of her future failings and though He has had to bring
              in much discipline Israel <em>will</em> receive His promises.
            </p>

            <p>
              If we focus on the Lord Jesus and not on ourselves we will find
              that the flesh will succeed less and less.  Satan wants us to
              look at ourselves, but the Lord's wants us to focus on Him and as
              we do so we will find that we can say with Paul “I have strength
              for all things in him that gives me power” (Philippians 4:13).
