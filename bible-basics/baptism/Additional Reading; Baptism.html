      <h1>Additional Reading: Baptism</h1>
      <div class="wrapped centered">
        <div>
          <p>
            We do not have to go far in Christendom to find opinions on the subject of baptism. Persons 
            may be heard on every hand extolling the virtues of “believer’s baptism”, “christening”, “household baptism”, 
            “sprinkling” and “immersion”. Baptism according to Christendom is thus a hotchpotch of confusing messages, 
            and for clear direction the child of God must turn away from these to the clear and living stream of God’s 
            Word. My title then is Baptism according to the Scriptures.
          </p>

      </div>
      <p>The basic idea involved in baptism is association or identification. It dissociates me from one sphere 
        of things and associates me with another. This is why baptism is always in relation to a name. It is who 
        we are baptized to that matters most (see Acts 19: 1-5). The practical effect of baptism is salvation, and 
        this will become clearer as we proceed.
      </p>

      <h2>John’s Baptism and the Lord’s Baptism in the Gospels.</h2>
      <div class="article">
        <p>
          The first baptism mentioned in the NT is that of John. This is not Christian baptism for the simple 
          reason that Christian baptism is unto Christ’s death (Rom. 6: 3), and Christ had not died when John was 
          baptizing. Nevertheless, although distinct from Christian baptism, John’s baptism sets forth the broad 
          principles governing it.
        </p>

        <p>The purpose of John’s baptism was to prepare persons for the imminent arrival of Christ: </p>
  
        <p class="scripture">
            John indeed baptized [with] the baptism of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe on him that 
            was coming after him, that is, on Jesus” (Acts 19: 4). 
        </p>

        <p>He himself said </p>

        <p class="scripture">
            “I [am] the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the path of [the] 
            Lord, as said Esaias the prophet” (John 1: 22-23). 
        </p>

        <p>The nation as a whole was in no fit state to receive its Messiah, and thus the God-fearing 
          remnant must dissociate themselves from it, clearing their names of the collective guilt, in 
          order to be ready. Baptism was the means by which this dissociation was achieved.
          </p>
        
        <p>
          Baptism is a figure of death (see Romans. 6: 4), and by being baptized the godly remnant 
          of Israel were acknowledging that there was no hope in the current order of things - they were 
          dying to it. They recognized that the relationship with Abraham was of no avail (compare Matthew. 3: 9), 
          and that there was a need to remove themselves from the guilty ground on which Israel stood. By being 
          baptized in the river Jordan (in itself a type of death), they took separate ground from the national 
          body, acknowledged their sinfulness, and cleared themselves from the sinful condition of the nation. 
          Furthermore, John’s baptism was not merely baptism, but a baptism of repentance (Matt. 3: 1-12). John 
          laid great stress on this: whenever he preached, he preached repentance, and whenever persons came to 
          be baptized he expected “fruit worthy of repentance” (Matt. 3: 8; Luke 3: 7-14). Without this baptism 
          the possibility of forgiveness is not even entertained: it was a baptism of repentance for the remission 
          of sins (see Mark 1: 4; Luke 3: 7). Those who refused to be baptized by John were without hope: “the Pharisees 
          and the lawyers rendered null as to themselves the counsel of God, not having been baptized by him” (Luke 7: 30).
        </p>

        <p>
            At first it might seem strange that the Lord Jesus Himself, being utterly without sin, should wish to submit 
            himself to a baptism of repentance (see Matt. 3: 13). There was a specific purpose behind this, however. John’s 
            own testimony was that he came baptizing with water in order that the Christ “might be manifested to Israel” (John 1: 31). 
            When this sinless One entered the waters of death the heavens could not remain silent, for to do so
             would have meant that the Lord was a sinner just like any other man. No, heaven must speak: 
        </p>

        <p class="scripture">
            And Jesus , having been baptized, went up straightway from the water, and lo, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the 
            Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon him: 
            and behold, a voice out of the heavens saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight.” (Matt. 3: 16-17). 
        </p>

        <p>God marked Him out as His chosen man - utterly sinless and utterly delightful to heaven. Following on from 
          this the Lord entered his public ministry.
        </p>

        <P>Part of the Lord’s public ministry (at least initially), involved baptism, though it was His disciples 
          rather than the Lord Himself who actually carried it out (compare John 3: 22 and 4: 1).  We are not told what 
          this baptism was, though it seems likely that it was to Christ as Messiah - that is, those baptized 
          desired to be associated with Him in that capacity. The baptism spoken of in connection with the 
          so-called Great commission (Matt. 28: 18-20) is wider in its outlook (“all the nations”), but I 
          would be inclined to the view that this is not Christian baptism, but a baptism associated with 
          the preaching of the kingdom after the rapture of the Church (see Matt. 24: 14).
        </P>

        <h2>The First Christian Baptisms</h2>
      <div class="article">

        <p>The first record of Christian baptism as such, is in Acts 2: 36-41 where Peter charges the Jewish 
          multitude with the murder of their Messiah: </p>

        <p class="scripture">
          Let the whole house of Israel therefore know assuredly that God has made him, this Jesus whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ” (v36). 
        </p>
        <p>
           As with John’s preaching, there was a need for dissociation in order for there to be blessing. Those convicted 
           of their sin were told to “Repent, and be baptized, each one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for remission of sins, 
           and ye will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit” (v38). The nation of Israel had crucified Christ, and the convicted Jew 
           had to clear himself of this national sin before there could be blessing. The call was “Be saved from this perverse generation” (v40), 
           meaning that they were to clear themselves of Israel’s sin by dissociating themselves in baptism from the nation. Instead 
           of being associated with those that had murdered Christ, they now associated themselves with the One they had crucified - 
           they were baptized “in the name of Jesus Christ” (v38, see v41). It was a complete change of ground.
        </p>

        <p>
          Following on from this incident with the Jews, we have the baptism of the Samaritans (Acts 8: 12-25), a hybrid 
          people part Hebrew and part Gentile, and the baptism of the Ethiopian eunuch (v26-39), who was in all probability 
          a Gentile. Now in the case of the Jews, baptism was essential before there could be blessing from God - dissociation 
          preceded the sealing of the Spirit (2: 38). However, with the Gentiles this order was reversed: when Cornelius 
          and his companions were converted the gift of the Spirit preceded baptism (Compare 10: 44 and v47,48). The reason 
          for this difference was that the Jews were God’s people, whilst the Gentiles were “strangers to the covenants of 
          promise, having no hope, and without God in the world” (Eph. 2: 12). The Jews had committed a terrible crime in 
          rejecting their Messiah - God’s Son - and had to clear themselves of this before they could count on any recognition 
          from God (a recognition witnessed to by the gift of the Holy Spirit). A Jew who remained unbaptised continued to be 
          associated with the cry of His Christ-rejecting countrymen: “Crucify him, crucify him” (Luke 23: 21, see also 19: 41). 
          How could God identify Himself (by His Spirit) with one who still remained identified with those who, though they 
          claimed to serve God, had rejected Him (in His Son)? He would be putting His sanction on a religion that though it 
          took His name, was in reality apostate. The Gentiles had no such special difficulty, and thus had no need to be 
          baptized before the gift of the Spirit could be sent to them.
        </p>

        <p>
          The case of the Samaritans was peculiar, because, as already indicated, they fitted neither the Jewish nor 
          the Gentile category. They believed “the glad tidings concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ”, 
          and “were baptized” (see Acts 8: 12), yet they did not receive the gift of the Holy Spirit until Peter and John came 
          down from Jerusalem (v17 - 18). The reason for this was because of the schism that existed between Samaria and 
          Jerusalem (John 4: 9, 27). Samaria denied the divine recognition the Jews claimed for the city of Jerusalem and its 
          temple (v20). However, despite all the claims they made for themselves, Scripture is explicit: “salvation is of the 
          Jews” (v22) - not Samaria. This schism had to be ended (the Assembly is one body - see Eph. 4: 4), and the Samaritans 
          brought into association with Jerusalem. It was therefore divinely ordered that the gift of the Holy Spirit should be
           withheld in their case until the two apostles came from Jerusalem and “laid their hands upon them” (v17) - a well-known 
           figure of identification. This meant an acknowledgment of Jerusalem as the true centre (Acts 1: 4), and the giving up 
           of their own false position. If the Spirit had been imparted to them at once, without any involvement from Jerusalem, 
           it might have resulted in the continuance of the existing rivalry. Peter is in the foreground again, and uses the keys 
           of the kingdom here with the Samaritans, just as he did on the day of Pentecost with the Jews, and later with the Gentiles.
        </p>

        <p>
          The incident of the Ethiopian eunuch (Acts 8: 26 - 39) sheds much light on the reasons for being baptized. On hearing 
          the “glad tidings of Jesus” (v35), the eunuch makes a sudden request to be baptized: “Behold water; what hinders my 
          being baptized?” (v36).
        </p>

        <p>
          Why did he do this? Is it not significant that the passage of Scripture he had been reading (and this is recorded 
          purposely for our benefit), ends with the words “for his life is taken from the earth” (v33). It is not unreasonable to 
          suppose that his request to be baptized was the result of realizing that his new master had been rejected and cast out by men. 
          His conclusion was that, if his Lord had no place here, then neither would he - he would depart from this scene in the waters of baptism.
        </p>

        <p>
          Note as well the way the Eunuch’s request is phrased: “Behold water; what hinders my being baptised?“ (Acts 8: 36 - my emphasis). 
          The answer is of course that there was nothing to hinder. There was no need to call the Assembly together, no need to go back to 
          Jerusalem to have the baptism in front of the crowds, no need to wait for anything. As soon as water becomes available, the eunuch 
          was baptised there and then. There was no need for delay. The eunuch exclaims: “Behold water” (v36). What happened next? “And he 
          commanded the chariot to stop. And they went down both to the water, both Philip and the eunuch, and he baptised Him” (v38). Of course 
          there were no crowds, for this was “desert” (v26), but that did not matter. The important thing was to get baptised. The New Testament 
          knows nothing of a delay between conversion and baptism.
        </p>

        <h2>Paul’s baptism and the “washing away of sins”.</h2>
      <div class="article">

        <p>
            Passing over several other references to baptism for the moment, let me now examine Acts 22: 16. In 
            the verses preceding, Paul recounts his conversion, and then relates what Ananias had said to him, including these words: 
        </p>

        <p class="scripture">
          "And now why lingerest thou? Arise and get baptised, and have thy sins washed away, calling on his name”. 
        </p>

        <p>
            This was obviously intended as a mild rebuke - clearly Ananias felt that Paul ought to have been baptised already since it was now three 
            days since his conversion (Acts 9: 9). Indeed, when Paul realised the urgency of the matter, he gave his baptism priority over 
            receiving food (compare v9 and v18-19).
        </p>

        <p>
          What does ‘washing away of sins’ mean in this context? Justification is “on the principle of faith” (Rom 5: 1), and so clearly 
          Ananias is not talking here about a washing that fits a man for heaven. No, the washing here was to fit Paul to be a testimony 
          to Christ on earth. It was an outward cleansing. His sins were taken away on the Damascus road by virtue of the blood of Christ 
          (Heb. 10: 4, 12) but until he was baptised, the sins of his old life were still outwardly attached to him. Paul had been a passionate 
          opponent and persecutor of the Christian faith and its adherents (Acts 22: 4), but in baptism he publicly washed it all away. When 
          he stepped into the water he was declaring that he was completely finished with his previous way of life (in effect, he was dying to 
          it). That old way of life he cut off with the waters of death. It was an act of dissociation.
        </p>

        <p>Romans 6: 1-14 deals with the claim of some that grace gives the believer licence to sin: </p>

        <p class="scripture">
          “What then shall we say? Should we continue in sin that grace may abound?” (v1). 
        </p>

        <p>
            Paul’s reply is scathing:
        </p>

        <p class="scripture">
            “Far be the thought. We who have died to sin, how 
            shall we still live in it? Are you ignorant that we, 
            as many as have been baptised unto Christ Jesus, have 
            been baptised unto his death?” (v2,3).
        </p>

        <p>
          Baptism is a picture of our death with Christ - a complete finishing with our former, sinful way of life. To propose to continue 
          in sin - for whatever reason - betrayed a fundamental ignorance of the meaning of baptism. That way of life we announced in baptism 
          as dead and buried - and like a buried corpse it should be put completely out of sight. What the foolish persons that Paul was dealing 
          with were suggesting was that it would be a good idea to parade it ! In being “baptised unto Christ Jesus” (v3) we are identified 
          with Him, but the apostle does not stop there but goes on to say that we are also “baptised unto his death” - that is, identified 
          with his death as well. Now the Lord Jesus died in order that the first man might be removed from before God, and if I am associated 
          with Him in His death then I am renouncing my old, sinful nature, and, in effect, confessing my own death with Christ. If, by baptism, 
          I have announced that my old way of life has gone in death, how can I possibly propose continuing in sin? It is a ludicrous contradiction!
        </p>

        <p>
            Now if baptism is “unto death”, it is also “in order that, even as Christ has been raised up from among [the] dead by the glory 
            of the Father, so we also should walk in newness of life” (v4). Baptism is thus the start of a new life (which is why it ought to 
            happen immediately on conversion) - a life different to the one submitted to the waters of baptism. It 
            must be different, for if we have ‘died’ in baptism, then we are “justified from sin” (v7). In our old lives we were in bondage to sin, and 
            the only way to be freed from that bondage is through death. In baptism we announce our death with Christ, 		and having thus died we are “justified 
            from sin”. As death releases the slave from service to his master, so our death with Christ (of which baptism is a figure) releases us from the 
            mastery of sin. Dead men cannot sin (and by submitting myself to the waters of baptism, I am announcing that I am dead). The believer has finished 
            with the old, sinful order of things - he has died with Christ and now seeks to walk in newness of life.
        </p>
  

        <h2>The effect of baptism on our attitude to sin</h2>
        <div class="article"></div>

        <p>
            Notice, however, that it does not say that the old man is dead. He is crucified (v6), but a crucified man is not necessarily dead. 
            He is condemned, and death is his only prospect, but, as we find out by practical experience, he is very much alive. The old sinful 
            nature is still with us. Thus there is a need to continually reckon ourselves “dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus” (v11). 
            ‘To reckon’ is an act of faith: we put ourselves where God has put us. It is a position and fact that has to be accepted rather than 
            a feeling to be experienced. If an attempt is made to experience it, the result can only be gross self-satisfaction (coupled with delusion), 
            or the despair and misery of utter failure. 
            We cannot feel dead to sin (and we soon realise this), but we can believe it. It is a work done for us, not in us.
        </p>

        <p>
          Christ has dealt with sin. He has “died to sin once for all” and now “lives to God” (v10). If we are associated with Him in 
          His death (set forth in baptism), then we too have finished with sin. From a practical point of view the need is to reckon ourselves 
          in this position - to reckon ourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus. If we reckon ourselves dead to sin then we will 
          not yield our members “instruments of unrighteousness to sin”, but will yield ourselves “to God as alive from among [the] dead” and our 
          members “instruments of righteousness to God” (v13). It is when we do not reckon ourselves dead that we give in to sin.
        </p>

        <h2>The importance of the name to which a person is baptised.</h2>
        <div class="article"></div>

        <p>
            In 1 Corinthians 1: 12 - 16 we see the importance of the name in which we are baptised. Sectarianism was rife 
            in Corinth with various names being lifted up as the heads of parties, including that of Paul: 
        </p>

        <p class="scripture">
            “But I speak of this, that each of you says, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ. Is the Christ divided? 
            Has Paul been crucified for you? or have ye been baptised unto the name of Paul? I thank 
            God that I have baptised none of you, unless Crispus and Gaius, that no one may say that I have baptised unto my own name.” 
        </p>

        <p>
            The anxiety here expressed by the apostle underlies the fact that the name in which a person is baptised associates us with the 
            possessor of that name. For example, the believers in Acts 19: 1-7 who did not possess the gift of the Holy Spirit were baptised unto John: 
        </p>

        <p class="scripture">
          And he said, To what then were ye baptised? And they said, To the baptism of John.” 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          They were identified with John rather than Christ. When, however, they heard about the Lord Jesus, they desired to be 
          associated with Him, and were “baptised to the name of the Lord Jesus”.
        </p>

        <p>
          The tenth chapter deals with what we might call the Mosaic baptism. Some have tried to make out that this is only a 
          figure of baptism, but that is a perversion of the clear words of Holy Scripture. It does not say ‘in figure all were 
          baptised unto Moses’ but “all were baptised unto Moses”. It was a baptism. Of course it wasn’t Christian baptism, but that 
          does not alter the fact that it was baptism! I quote in full the relevant passage: “For I would not have you ignorant, brethren, 
          that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all 
          passed through the sea; and all were baptised unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea” (v 1-2).
        </p>

        <p>
          I shall return to these verses more fully later, but it is worth drawing attention to a few broad points now. Firstly, 
          we have again the importance of the name to which we are baptised: “…..unto Moses”. Secondly, we have association and 
          dissociation. The Israelites “were baptised unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea”. The cloud was the cloud of divine 
          protection and guidance (Ex. 13: 21), and those who put themselves under it put themselves where Moses was - they were 
          associated with him. The sea (that is, the Red Sea), dissociated Moses (and those who went with him) from Egypt. They 
          were separated from what speaks of the world. To fully understand the sense of this being baptised “unto Moses” we must 
          turn to the historical record of the events in Exodus 14: 31. There we read that after passing through the Red Sea, the 
          children of Israel “feared Jehovah, and believed in Jehovah, 
          and in Moses his bondman”. They acknowledged the leadership of Moses, and in passing through the water were set apart 
          (baptised) to him as his disciples. They cut themselves off from the old order of 	 things (Egypt) and were baptised 
          to their deliverer. Thirdly, salvation was included in the baptism, since by the dissociation accomplished at the baptism 
          of the Red Sea, the children of Israel were saved from the Egyptians. The separating character of the Sea saved them.

        <h2>Baptism and ‘putting on Christ’.</h2>
        <div class="article"></div>

        <p>
          The next New Testament verse that needs examining is Galatians 3: 27. Now this verse has perplexed many, for in it the 
          apostle Paul declares that it is in baptism that we put on Christ: “For ye, as many as have been baptised unto Christ, 
          have put on Christ”. No, not when we believed the 
          Gospel (as we might expect), but when we were baptised, and only then. How then, do we put on Christ in baptism?
        </p>

        <p>
          Imagine a young man joining the army. As soon as he takes the oath of allegiance to the head of state, he becomes a 
          member of the service, but he is still in civilian clothes. In the eyes of the world around he is still a civilian! When, 
          however, he puts his uniform on it is obvious to all that he is no longer a civilian, but a soldier. Now the same principle 
          applies with the believer. When he is converted, he becomes a Christian - he takes the “oath of allegiance” to his Lord. 
          However, not until he is baptised can the Christian be said to have put on his uniform - to have “put on Christ”. Baptism 
          puts us on Christian ground in the eyes of the world - it is the taking of a positive step of distinction from the world. 
          Orientals understand this truth far better than persons in the West. Thus when a Jew or Muslim is converted, his new-found 
          faith is tolerated - he can still be persuaded of his “folly”. When he gets baptised, however, that is it - literally. They 
          will have no more to do with him. He has taken off the uniform of Judaism or Islam and put on Christ. This explains why Paul 
          goes on to say “There is no Jew nor Greek; there is no bondman nor freeman; there is no male and female; for ye are all one 
          in Christ Jesus” (Gal. 3: 28). The uniform of the Jew or the Greek, the bondman or the freeman, was off - they had the uniform 
          of Christ on. They had “put on Christ” (v27).
        </p>

        <h2>Baptism: ‘burial’ and ‘new life’.</h2>
        <div class="article"></div>

        <p>
          In Colossians 2: 12, baptism is seen not only to be death, but burial: 
        </p>

        <p class="scripture">
          buried with him in baptism, in which ye have been also raised with [him] 
          through faith of the working of God who raised him from among the dead”. 
        </p>

        <p>
          In being identified with Him in His death we not only die, but we are buried with him - that is, we go completely out of sight. 
          That order of man is utterly finished. (Incidentally, that is why Biblical baptism is not sprinkling, but immersion). Burial is 
          the complete and final thought with regard to death - when a dead man is put in the grave, then it is obvious to all that it is 
          the end. The effect of baptism is the same in principle.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, it can also be seen, yet again, that baptism is with a view to another life. The Christian coming up out of the waters 
          of baptism signifies his being raised out of death with Christ, to walk in association with Him in newness of life. Hence the 
          apostle goes on “in which ye have been also raised with [him] through faith of the working of God who raised him from among the dead. And 
          you, being dead in offences and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, he has quickened together with him…..” (v12, 13).
        </p>

        <p>Finally, there is 1 Peter 3: 18-22: </p>

        <p class="scripture">
          "for Christ indeed has once suffered for sins, [the] just for [the] unjust, that he might bring us to God; being put 
          to death in flesh, but made alive in [the] Spirit, in which also going he preached to the spirits [which are] in prison, 
          heretofore disobedient, when the longsuffering of God waited in [the] days of Noah while the ark was preparing, into which 
          few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water: which figure also now saves you, [even] baptism, not a putting away of 
          [the] filth of the flesh, but [the] demand as before God of a good conscience, by [the] resurrection of Jesus Christ, who is at 
          [the] right hand of God, gone into heaven, angels and authorities and powers being subjected to him”.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now Noah and his family were saved by two means: by the water of the flood (as stated here), and by the ark, and the difference 
            between the two is the difference between faith and baptism. Water saved Noah in that it was used in the judgment of God to 
            destroy the old corrupt world with which he had been connected, and brought him into a new and better 
            world. In the same way, baptism severs our links with one system and links us outwardly with another. The water which was the 
            death of the world saved Noah. Of course, the ark also saved Noah’s life, but it saved him from the judgment, not from an 
            evil world. The ark can thus be likened to the salvation that comes as a result of faith in God. It was left to the water (like baptism) 
            to save Noah from an evil world.
        </p>

        <p>
          Certainly, baptism is only a “figure”, and accomplishes nothing vital and eternal, but it is certainly more than a mere ceremonial 
          washing. It is, as Peter says, “[the] demand as before God of a good conscience” (v21). Thus the Ethiopian eunuch on understanding 
          His Lord was given no place here, cries out “Behold water; what hinders my being baptised?” (Acts 8: 36). A good conscience demands 
          baptism, considering it faithfulness to the Master to be in figure cut 
          off from the old life, even as He was literally cut off in death. Conscience requires such an identification with Him.
        </p>

        <h2>New Testament baptisms: The Philippian jailor.</h2>
        <div class="article"></div>

        <p>
          As one would expect, there are several instances of individuals being baptised in the New Testament. What is not commonly 
          known, is that there are several instances of households being baptised - that is, baptised as households. These include 
          Cornelius (Acts 10: 47-48, 11: 13-14), Lydia (Acts 16: 14-15), Crispus (Acts 18: 8) and Stephanas (1 Cor. 1: 16). Most controversial 
          of all, there is the case of the Philippian jailor (Acts 16: 33-34). It is worth quoting the whole passage in full:
        </p>

        <p class="scripture">
          “And it came to pass as we were going to prayer that a certain female slave, having a spirit of Python, met us, who brought 
          much profit to her masters by prophesying. She, having followed Paul and us, cried saying These men are bondmen of the Most 
          High God, who announce to you [the] way of salvation. And this she did many days. And Paul, being distressed, turned, and said 
          to the spirit, I enjoin thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And it came out the same hour. And her masters, 
          seeing that the hope of their gains was gone, having seized Paul and Silas, dragged [them] into the market before the magistrates; 
          and having brought them up to the praetors, said, These men utterly trouble our city, being Jews, and announce customs which it 
          is not lawful for us to receive nor practise, being Romans. And the crowd rose up too against them; and the praetors, having torn 
          off their clothes, commanded to scourge [them]. And having laid many stripes upon them they cast [them] into prison, charging the 
          jailor to keep them safely; who, having received such a charge, cast them into the inner prison, and secured their feet to the stocks. 
          And at midnight Paul and Silas, in praying, were praising God with singing, and the prisoners listened to them. And suddenly there 
          was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison shook, and all the doors were immediately opened, and the bonds of 
          all loosed. And the jailor being awakened out of his sleep, and seeing the doors of the prison opened, having drawn a sword was 
          going to kill himself, thinking the prisoners had fled. But Paul called out with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm, for we 
          are all here. And having asked for lights, he rushed in, and, trembling, fell down before Paul and Silas. And leading them out said, 
          Sirs, what must I do that I may be saved? And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus and thou shalt be saved, thou and thy house. And 
          they spoke to him the word of the Lord, with all that were in his house. And he took them the same hour of the night and washed [them] 
          from their stripes; and was baptised, he and all his straightway. And having brought them into his house he laid the table [for them], 
          and rejoiced with all his house, having believed in God.” (Acts 16: 16-34)
        </p>

        <p class="scripture">
          “Now one of the malefactors who had been hanged spoke insultingly to
          him, saying, Art not thou the Christ? save thyself and us. But the
          other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost thou too not fear God, thou
          that art under the same judgment? and we indeed justly, for we
          receive the just recompense of what we have done; but this [man] has
          done nothing amiss. And he said to Jesus, Remember me, Lord, when
          thou comest in thy kingdom. And Jesus said to him, Verily I say to
          thee, To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise.” (Luke 23v39-43).
        </p>

        <p>
          Baptism is quite clearly connected with salvation in some of the
          sections above and yet it is quite clear in other scriptures that
          salvation from our sins is by faith alone. The section about the
          thief on the cross clinches the point when the Lord says that he
          would be with Him in paradise and yet there was no possible way the
          thief could be baptised. All the thief had was faith and it was on
          that basis he received blessing.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Bible isn’t contradictory so there must be a way to explain why
          remission of sins and salvation is connected with baptism when the
          whole point of the gospel in scripture is that we are saved and
          justified by faith.
        </p>

        <p>
          One explanation is that the Jews needed to outwardly separate from
          the sins of the Jewish nation who crucified Christ. So the sins
          washed away in baptism presumably were the outward sins of the nation
          from which they were disassociating themselves. Their own personal
          sins were forgiven in repentance and they were exiting the Jewish
          nation with all it stood for in the rejection of the Lord in baptism.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another thought for consideration are the several types of salvation
          in scripture.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
              Salvation from our sins (see Acts 2v21, Acts 4v12, Romans 8v24,
              1Corinthians 1v18, 1 Corinthians 15v1-4, etc).
          </li>
          <li>
              Salvation from the present world (see Acts 2v40, Romans 15v31,
              Titus 3v3 – an ongoing process?, 1 Peter 4v17-19, see also Romans
              7 and 8 plus John 17v9-11).
          </li>
          <li>
              Salvation still to come (see Romans 5v9, 1 Corinthians 3v15, 1
              Corinthians 5v5, Hebrews 9v28).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          So, there is a completed, present and future aspect to salvation. Our
          sins have been forgiven and washed away by the work of the Lord Jesus
          on the cross. We are at present being saved from our sinful flesh and
          the world around us with the help of the Holy Spirit (see also
          Galatians 5v17). We shall be saved completely when the Lord comes for
          us and takes us out of this world where we shall never be troubled by
          unbelieving mankind or sin again. Perhaps we can think of it like
          this: Our souls have been subjugated by the Lord, our spirits are now
          being subjugated by Him as we learn His will passing through a world
          that persecutes us and finally our bodies will be subjugated being
          changed to be like His glorious body.
        </p>

        <p>
          Romans 6 speaks about baptism in the context of living for Christ on
          the earth. 1 Corinthians 12v13 connects baptism with Christ’s body
          which is on earth. John the Baptist connected his baptism with a
          change in attitudes of life. Therefore, baptism must be in relation
          to present salvation. If it was necessary for past or future
          salvation the Lord would have ensured that the thief on the cross had
          a miraculous baptism or he would have told him that he couldn’t be
          saved because he wasn’t baptised. Thus, baptism must be linked with
          sanctification, i.e. being set apart for God and living for Him (see
          Titus 3v5).
        </p>

        <p class="scripture">
          "And ye are complete in him, who is the head of all principality and
          authority, in whom also ye have been circumcised with circumcision
          not done by hand, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the
          circumcision of the Christ; buried with him in baptism, in which ye
          have been also raised with him through faith of the working of God
          who raised him from among the dead." (Colossians 2v10-12).
        </p>

        <p>
          Colossians 2v10-12 connects baptism with circumcision. While there
          are some differences (e.g. circumcision was only for males, baptism
          for all) this does connect baptism with earth which, like
          circumcision, is also a sign of a covenant. This would make sense
          explaining why there was no need for the thief on the cross to be
          baptised. He had only hours to live and he was physically condemned
          to death in the world. He had put his trust in the Lord Jesus and he
          wasn’t actually going to be living in the world anymore. A deathbed
          convert is the same. They have but moments to live. There is no need
          for baptism because they aren’t going to be in the world anymore and
          don't need present salvation for life.
        </p>

        <h2>Does baptism confer anything on a person?</h2>
        <p>
          No, the previously mentioned scriptures (and many others besides) on
          salvation from sins show that all that is necessary for eternal
          salvation is to have faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. “For with the
          heart is believed to righteousness” (Romans 10v10). It seems to be a
          personal exercise whereby someone is identified with Christ,
          rejecting the world valuation of Christ and submitting to Him in his
          rule over their life, being marked out for God. By doing so we are
          associated with what is the Lord’s on earth in His sight, i.e. His
          body on earth. It is with the purpose of living then as reckoning
          ourselves dead to sin and alive to God. Peter shows that it is with
          the purpose of enabling us to live with a good conscience before God.
          It has nothing to do with eternal salvation but rather with present
          salvation from the influences of an evil world. I suppose that every
          believer should be constantly going through the baptism exercise
          everyday despite baptism itself only needing to be done once. We must
          always think nothing of ourselves and give everything to the Lord,
          submitting to His will.
