        <h1>Leadership in the church</h1>
        <div class="wrapped centered">
          <div>
            <p>
                This study is the result of a personal desire to understand whether Christendom has changed the Biblical perception of leadership in the 
                Church.  The concept of there being a spiritual leader in any church is fairly widespread.  This leader may take one of a number of different 
                titles including minister, vicar, priest, pastor, bishop and deacon.  Essentially, it is the same thing – they are spiritual leaders, either 
                appointed or elected who provide leadership to the church whom they serve often taking an often meagre salary to do this work.
            </p>

            <p>
                Many of the people who occupy such positions are godly men who have devoted their lives for the service of God to His people.  However, is this 
                practice founded on scripture?

            <h2>What does it mean?</h2>

            <p>
                First, here are the meanings of some of the words found in church hierarchies.
            </p>

            <table style="width:80%">
                <tr>
                  <th>Bishop/Pastor</th>
                  <td>The word ‘bishop’ means shepherd. The Bible gives no basis for it being used as a title for an office.  A bishop is a person who has a 
                    concern for other believers and takes an interest in overseeing their spiritual development.
                    </td> 
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <th>Apostle</th>
                  <td>The word ‘apostle’ means ‘sent one’.  This is someone who is sent by God for particular purpose.  Paul refers to himself as apostle to 
                    the nations and so he had God given authority to complete the mission that he had been given to build and establish the churches in Asia 
                    Minor and Europe.

                  <th>Minister</th>
                  <td>To be a minister simply means that you serve others.  This may be in a variety of ways.  Every Christian is to minister to (serve) 
                    others.  Someone may ‘minister’ to someone, i.e. serve them.  This might involve teaching but may also refer to a wide range of services., 
                    e.g. many people are described as ministering to the Lord (such as the women in Luke 8:3) and Phoebe in Romans 16:1 who is described as a 
                    minister but certainly wouldn’t have taught the Cenchrean church given Paul’s word about women and teaching men (1 Timothy 2:12).

              <h2>The gifts and where they come from ...</h2>
              <p>
                  God has given gifts to the Church/Assembly to strengthen it and edify it.  Every believer has been given grace.  <b>“But to each one of us 
                    has been given grace according to the measure of the gift of the Christ” (Ephesians 4:7).</b>  Grace is where God has given us favour that we 
                    do not deserve.  In His grace He has given the Church a number of gifts to enable us all to grow in faith and the knowledge of God.  
                    Having left the Church and ascended up to the right hand of God the Lord Jesus has sent the Holy Spirit to dwell in the Church/Assembly 
                    and also given many gifts which will maintain the Church/Assembly in preparation for the Lord’s coming again. <b>“Wherefore he says, Having 
                    ascended up on high, he has led captivity captive, and has given gifts to men” (Ephesians 4:8).</b>
              </p>

              <p>
                <b>
                    “He that descended is the same who has also ascended up above all the heavens, that he 	might fill all things; and he has given some apostles, 
                    and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints; with a view to the work of the ministry, 
                    with a view to the edifying of the body of Christ; until we all arrive at the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, at the full-grown 
                    man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of the Christ” (Ephesians 4:10-13).
                </b>
              </p>

              <p>
                <b>
                    “And God has set certain in the assembly: first, apostles; secondly, prophets; thirdly, teachers; then miraculous powers; then gifts of 
                    healings; helps; governments; kinds of tongues” (1 Corinthians 12:28).
                </b>
              </p>

         

            <p>
                The key thing to note here is that apostle, prophets, evangelists, shepherds (or Bishops) and teachers (or ministers) are given by God.  The 
                titles of these gifts have been used by many in Christendom to given names to particular offices in a church.  In some churches these people 
                are chosen by a leader, moderator or even a Head of State.  They may also be elected into office bearing the name of one of these gifts.  
                However, it can rarely be said that God has given these persons the office they occupy.  Rather a man, woman or council has given them their 
                office.  This is an important distinction to make – the gifts, as described in the Bible, are given to persons directly by God, whereas in 
                Christendom they are generally conferred by mankind.
            </p>
           
            <p>
                Another point to note is that it appears from this scripture (and others that we’ll see later) that in Ephesus there were more than one of 
                each gift, in fact, there may have been many persons who had been given one of these gifts.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>
                  “For, as in one body we have many members, but all the members have not the same office; thus we, being many, are one body in Christ, and 
                  each one members one of the other. But having different gifts, according to the grace which has been given to us, whether it be prophecy, 
                  let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith; or service, let us occupy ourselves in service; or he that teaches, in teaching; or 
                  he that exhorts, in exhortation; he that gives, in simplicity; he that leads, with diligence; he that shews mercy, with cheerfulness” 
                  (Romans 12:4-8).

              </b>
            </p>

            <p>
                In Romans 12, Paul again connects the offices with the giving of God in His grace.  The Church is to contain a variety of persons and gifts 
                that, when used appropriately and under His influence, will build up and edify every Christian.  It is clear that there are not simply one of 
                each in a church but rather there are many gifts within the same local church which the Holy Spirit will use for the blessing of all the 
                Christians that gather there.  He tells the Roman church that whatever God has given us to do we should do it diligently and cheerfully, not 
                seeking to take on things that have been given to others to do and learning from them just as much as others might learn from them.
            </p>

            <p>
                Another thing that is obvious here is that there is no mention of anyone having any form of official qualification to have received one of 
                these gifts.  There is no mention of any degree, bible college certificate, apprenticeship, etc, that needs to be gained before someone can 
                be given any of these things.  This is consistent with the whole of the scriptures.  Moses, Elijah, Elisha and many others were called into 
                service.  It was only after they had begun to serve God that He gave them the training that they needed to complete the work that He had 
                given them to do.  They were appointed (or called) into service and then they were fitted for service.  This is not the way mankind does things 
                but it is the way God has always done things.  The idea that someone must have a qualification before they can start on the service to which 
                God has called them is entirely an idea of Man not God.

                  God, which he has purchased with the blood of his own” (Acts 20:28).</b>  Here again the place of an overseer (or elder) is given by the 
                  Holy Spirit and not by anyone else.  More on this later.
