          <p>What is it all about? (To be edited â€¦)</p>
          <p>"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth." (Genesis 1v1) "And God saw every thing that he had made,
            and, behold, it was very good." (Genesis 1v31)</p>
          <p>God made the world and everything in it. The imprint of His wisdom and power is all around us.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>The fall of mankind and death...</strong>
          </p>
          <p>"And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree
            of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt
            surely die." (Genesis 2v16-17)</p>
          <p>"And unto Adam [God] said, Because thou ... hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt
            not eat of it: ... in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of
            it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return." (Genesis 3v17-19)</p>
          <p>Since then, we have all continued in sin...</p>
          <p>"Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that
            all have sinned." (Romans 5v12)</p>
          <p>We are unable to save ourselves...</p>
          <p>"For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God" (Romans 3v23)</p>
          <p>"Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we
            must be saved." (Acts 4v12)</p>
          <p>So God gave his son to save us...</p>
          <p>"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish,
            but have everlasting life." (John 3v16)</p>
          <p>"Without shedding of blood is no remission [of sin]" (Hebrews 9v22)</p>
          <p>Jesus never sinned... (so only he can save us)</p>
          <p>"Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps: who did no sin, neither was
            guile found in his mouth: who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but
            committed himself to him that judgeth righteously." (1 Peter 2v21-23)</p>
          <p>He "was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin." (Hebrews 4v15)</p>
          <p>He died for our sins instead of us...</p>
          <p>"For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly." (Romans 5v6)</p>
          <p>"When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the
            ghost." (John 19v30)</p>
          <p>"And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said
            thus, he gave up the ghost." (Luke 23v46)</p>
          <p>...and rose from the dead.</p>
          <p>"And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, [the angels] said unto them, Why seek ye the
            living among the dead? He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,
            saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise
            again. And they remembered his words." (Luke 24v5-8)</p>
          <p>"That Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; and that he was buried, and that he rose again the
            third day according to the scriptures: and that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve: after that, he was
            seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are
            fallen asleep. After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles. And last of all he was seen of me"
            (1 Corinthians 15v3-8)</p>
          <p>Jesus is in Heaven</p>
          <p>"God having spoken in many parts and in many ways formerly to the fathers in the prophets, at the end of these
            days has spoken to us in the person of the Son, whom he has established heir of all things, by whom also he made
            the worlds; who being the effulgence of his glory and the expression of his substance, and upholding all things
            by the word of his power, having made by himself the purification of sins, set himself down on the right hand
            of the greatness on high" (Hebrews 1v1-3)</p>
          <p>"And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the
            cross. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: that at the
            name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and
            that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father." (Philippians 2v8-11)</p>
          <p>You can be saved...</p>
          <p>"Our Saviour God, who desires that all men should be saved and come to the knowledge of [the] truth." (1 Timothy
            2v4)
          </p>
          <p>"but now [God] commandeth all men every where to repent" (Acts 17v30)</p>
          <p>"The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanses us from all sin." (1 John 1v7)</p>
          <p>"If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us [our] sins, and cleanse us from all unrighteousness."
            (1 John 1v9)</p>
          <p>"Believe on the Lord Jesus and thou shalt be saved" (Acts 16v31)</p>
          <p>PS: About the future...</p>
          <p>Jesus is coming again for those who have trusted in Him...</p>
          <p>"For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump
            of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together
            with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord." (1Thessalonians
            4v17-18)
          </p>
          <p>But the world will be judged...</p>
          <p>"And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened,
            which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according
            to their works. And the sea gave up the dead which were in it.... and whosoever was not found written in the
            book of life was cast into the lake of fire." (Revelation 20v12-15)</p>
